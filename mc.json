Reduce stress Reduce mild anxiety Improve mood Fight mid-day fatigue Increase energy Research has shown there's a link between stress, tension, and excess belly fat - high levels of cortisol - a nasty little stress hormone - can cause pound after pound of excess body fat to accumulate around your waist and tummy - a health-threatening, figure-destroying condition affecting an estimated 47 million Americans, mostly women. But now there's Relacore - the breakthrough, all-natural, anti-anxiety, mood-elevating pill that, in conjunction with a sensible diet and exercise program, helps reduce stress-related cortisol production, thereby helping to reduce belly fat. You're going to love it! Relacore -The natural feel-good pill - might be the perfect answer to belly fat: Relacore - The natural feel good pill - might be the perfect answer to belly fat. Relacore is a non-sedating, mild anti-anxiety mood enhancer that reduces stress-related cortisol production by helping to minimize stress, says Dr. Nathalie Chevreau, PhD, RD, Director of Women's Health and Nutrition. Those who have used Relacore reported an overall feeling of well-being, less anxiety, much more energy and a greater ability to handle the problems of everyday life. It all begins when you take the easy-to-swallow Relacore capsules twice a day. In as little as a few hours, you'll be able to tell a difference in your overall stress level. If you're susceptible to stress-related belly fat retention and you use Relacore in conjunction with proper diet and exercise, you'll soon begin to see a visible reduction in your belly fat. But there's more! Relacore also helps balance hormone levels that cause stress-related belly fat and encourage overeating.

      "text": "Elite XT Extended Release protein is designed to be the ultimate muscle fuel and workout recovery formula. Dymatize determined that no single existing natural protein source was ideal for achieving extended release anabolic effects. The optimal source was found to be a fusion of several different protein sources, including the addition of free form branched chain amino acids and milk-derived proteins.\r\n\t\r\n\tElite XT Extended Release Protein is designed to be the ultimate muscle fuel and workout recovery formula. Knowing that protein repairs muscle after the workout and fuels the body throughout the day, Dymatize wanted to develop a product that took recovery to the next level, one that would revolutionize the protein category. After a battery of tests and trials, we have developed a calculated protein timing system that we call Sustained Muscle Saturation Technology (SMST).\r\n\tHow does SMST work?\r\n\tDifferent proteins have different chemical compositions and different rates at which they can be assimilated by the body. By developing an absorption \"time-line\" of the highest quality proteins, we were able to create the basis of Elite XT. To develop Dymatize Elite XT, every facet of protein usage was analyzed. Nitrogen retention, absorption as well as several other factors including specific amino acid profiles were examined. Some of these additional factors included:\r\n\t1-Rate of Absorption (RA): The rate each different protein source releases its amino acid.\r\n\t2-Protein Digestibility Correct Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS): An evaluation \"best method\" used by the FDA and FAO/WHO, which uses nitrogen absorption and amino acid profile to rate quality.\r\n\t3-Amino Acid Profile: Each protein source has its own unique amino acid profile.\r\n\t4-Biological Value (BV): Derived from the amount of Nitrogen absorbed over the amount of Nitrogen incorporated into the body. Helps determine the amount of protein absorbed from different protein sources.\r\n\t5- Net Protein Utilization (NPU): is used to determine the ideal amount of essential amino acids.\r\n\tElite XT features Nutrateric, a pharmaceutically developed coating system, is utilized on some of the ingredients to help provide an extended release of protein over a longer, extended period of time. This coating system is pH sensitive and is designed to help provide a prolonged delivery-further enhancing the extended release capacity of Dymatize Elite XT. Lastly, we have added the advanced enzyme matrix Zytrix to help aid the efficiency of the absorption of protein and other nutrients found in Elite XT. Furthermore, there is an added lipid blend that is specifically designed to help promote a longer absorption rate of the proteins by creating a complete anabolic, nitrogen rich environment which is sustained in the body for an extended period of time. Gluten Free.\r\n\t \r\n\tMix 1 to 2 scoops of Dymatize Elite XT with 8 fluid ounces of cold water, milk or juice. Adjust the amount of fluid to achieve desired taste and consistency.

If you mix the chocolate peanut butter flavor with ice, it tastes a lot like Reese’s Pieces and you can’t get much better than that!\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat sets ISOFLEX apart?\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat is whey and why is it so valued as the core foundation of every serious performance nutrition program? Whey is a thin, watery portion of milk chockfull of high-grade protein that’s separated during cheese production. It is extracted through a two-step process. The type of extraction conducted to separate whey from milk is what really determines the quality of whey protein. It’s this exact process that also sets ISOFLEX protein powder apart from others on the market.\r\n\t\r\n\tHow is ISOFLEX made?\r\n\t\r\n\tISOFLEX is extracted through CTP™ (Cold Temperature Process) microfiltration. This is a cross-flow microfiltration (CFM) process that removes the larger, less absorbable protein molecules while filtering out fat, lactose and ash that are normally present in whey concentrates and other lower quality protein powders. This is similar to the way reverse osmosis in water purification works.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Low Temperature Microfiltration Provides Undenatured Protein with many Bioactive Whey Protein Fractions\r\n\t\r\n\tCFM is one of the best methods for extracting protein on the market today. The whole process takes place at a chilly 4 degrees Celsius, or 39 degrees Fahrenheit and leaves almost 100% of the protein and peptides intact. It also yields the highest amount of undenatured (bio-active) protein available.\r\n\t\r\n\tOur whey protein isolates are manufactured by chilling or low temperature microfiltration process and dried by indirect heat. The low temperature microfiltration process allows the whey protein isolates to provide undenatured protein with a full balance of bioactive whey protein fractions, including high levels of naturally occurring immunoglobulin, lactoferrin and glycomacropeptides (GMP).\r\n\t\r\n\tThe filtration ceramic membranes used for the CFM process are extraordinarily fine and have the ability to remove even more lactose, ash and fat than the process of ultra-filtration, which is used for lower quality whey protein products. Using this sophisticated process, ALLMAX is able to produce ISOFLEX, a superior ultra pure protein that maintains an optimal macronutrutient ratio, yielding 27 grams of protein, 1 gram of carbohydrate and 0 grams of fat.\r\n\t\r\n\tISOFLEX contains pure whey protein\r\n\t\r\n\tOther whey processing technologies use higher temperatures that cause irreversible unfolding of the protein fractions that can drastically reduce the biological activity of the protein. Based on solubility at a pH of 4.6, ISOFLEX has a mere 3% denatured proteins, which is approximately 10% less than ion-exchange whey protein isolates and typically less than other microfiltration whey protein isolates. ISOFLEX also contains up to 12 times more native GMP than ion-exchange whey protein isolates.\r\n\t\r\n\tHow is whey protein isolate produced?\r\n\t\r\n\tTo produce whey isolate the protein goes through the following steps:\r\n\t\r\n\tFresh milk is tested by quality assurance experts.\r\n\tThe curd portion of the milk fat is separated out for cheese.\r\n\tThe watery liquid portion that is chockfull of high-grade protein is filtered through a microfiltration process to remove lactose and ash.\r\n\tThe concentrated liquid goes through the CFM process, which eliminates the need for harsh chemicals used in other processes.\r\n\tThe water is removed and the whey is dried.\r\n\tUltra pure whey protein isolate is packaged and ready for our ALLMAX customer.\r\n\t\r\n\tcgmpAll of these steps are performed at a cGMP licensed manufacturing facility to ensure quality and integrity.\r\n\t\r\n\tEvery ingredient and every lot produced is independently lab tested for purity and quality to ensure consistent quality every time.\r\n\t\r\n\tISOFLEX is manufactured in the US with US Dairy Cows.

      "text": "BLACK POWDER ULTRA\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe all-new BLACK POWDER ULTRA gives you\r\n\tadvanced ingredients and compounds to:\r\n\tRegardless of individual endeavors, serious, goal-oriented athletes and fitness enthusiasts share one thing in common; an obsession with results. In a quest to turn their aspirations into physical realities, they train with a raging fury of training intensity. This can lead to one more shared attribute - the dreaded fitness \"plateau.\" When the mind and body can no longer keep pace with advanced training regimens, all performance progress can come to a screeching halt.*\r\n\tMRI BLACK POWDER ULTRA was expressly formulated to match the mental and physical intensity demands of hard-training athletes. The potential for BLACK POWDER ULTRA to drive \"next level\" performance is nothing short of astounding. Each ingredient, compound and technology in this unprecedented formula was selected based on the latest emerging research in performance nutrition. What you get is a pre-workout formula powerful enough to fuel your insatiable drive.*\r\n\tWhat would a performance driving pre-workout product be without a focus and training intensity-driving component? BLACK POWDER ULTRA leverages the latest in clinically researched ingredients to bring you an unprecedented, full-on mental performance experience. If you're not in the \"working out frame of mind\" before your first sip of BLACK POWDER ULTRA... you soon will be. BLACK POWDER ULTRA was designed to engage your CNS and support your energy and focus to razor sharp intensity.*\r\n\tTo gain a better vantage point of how BLACK POWDER ULTRA supports powerful mind-muscle connections, we will start with a little background on how the nervous system works. Nerve cells, called neurons, are filled with \"communication chemicals\" called neurotransmitters. When a signal reaches the end of a nerve, neurotransmitters are released. The neurotransmitters cross the synapse; the space between the nerve and the receiving cell. The receiving cell(s) \"pick-up\" the neurotransmitters through receptors that allow for the signal to \"deliver its message.\" Acetylcholine is a primary neurotransmitter in the brain that supports cognition. In muscle cells, acetylcholine carries the signal that engages strong contractions. In this image, you see a close up of a muscle cell receiving acetylcholine. The small indentation on the muscle, just under each nerve ending, is called the post synaptic membrane. The connection between a signaling nerve and the muscle cell that it stimulates is called the neuromuscular junction.*\r\n\tYour BLACK POWDER ULTRA training drive launches with the time-tested, clinically validated and always reliable power of caffeine. Here are some interesting things to know about caffeine. Caffeine is an FDA-approved ingredient as a stimulant for improving psychomotor performance.i Authoritative sources have documented that caffeine has a stimulating effect on the central nervous system, which results in a temporary energizing effect.ii In addition, a recent meta-analysis of 21 studies examined the effects of caffeine on subjective feelings of vigor and energy. In comparison to placebo, caffeine reduced the rate of perceived exertion during exercise by 5.6% (95% CI: -4.5-6.7%).* In addition, caffeine improved exercise performance by 11.2% (95% CI: 4.6-17.8%).*iii\r\n\tOf course, BLACK POWDER ULTRA wouldn't be \"ultra\" without even more neuromodulating ingredients. Enter Mucuna Pruiens and Taurine.\r\n\tHere's the scoop on M. pruriens - it's been around for quite some time. In the ancient Indian system of medicine, the Ayurveda and Unani, and also the Chinese system of traditional remedies, M. pruriens seeds were used as a tonic, for the improvement of endurance against stress, supporting the immune system, and more.*iv,v,vi Furthermore, M. pruriens has been traditionally used to support sexual health, and for its possible adaptogenic, and neuromodulator support.*\r\n\tNow for the Taurine side of the equation. Large amounts of taurine are found in the human brain. This is an important consideration because taurine is known to be involved in central nervous system neuromodulation.vii Taurine appears to have multiple functions in the brain including neurotransmission. To explain why requires getting a bit technical. Taurine it may exert its neuromodulating actions by serving as an agonist at receptors of the GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmitter systems.*viii\r\n\tFirst, let's get something straight. Nitric Oxide is a powerful signaling molecule in the body. Second, for the Arginine \"naysayers\" out there, studies reveal that the availability of intracellular arginine is a rate-limiting factor of all types of NOS.ix,x,xi Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from L-ARG by NO synthase (NOS) in virtually all cell types.xii,xiii BLACK POWDER ULTRA delivers premium Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate - an excellent source of nitric oxide-generating fuel.*\r\n\tOne of the key signaling pathways of nitric oxide is in the endothelial cells of the vascular system. There, nitric oxide triggers the smooth muscles that surround blood vessels to relax - promoting vascular dilation. This effect is known as vasodilaton (a.k.a. \"hemodilation\" in MRI terms). In turn, hemodilation promotes optimal blood flow that drives nutrients to muscles and vascular \"pumps.\"*\r\n\tNow, it goes without saying that generating more nitric oxide equals greater potential for massive \"pumps.\" That's where CFM Nitro kicks in. CFM Nitro (ACTINOS®) is a powerful fractionated whey peptide that actually upregulates NOS enzymes! NOS enzymes are the \"factories\" that convert L-Arginine fuel into hemodilating nitric oxide. We are not talking about a small increase in NOS here. One in vitro study has found that lung cells exposed to Actinos (fractionated whey peptides) significantly increase nitric oxide production in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 474% to 1,169%.*xiv\r\n\tBLACK POWDER ULTRA is a multi-force workout amplifier that works on a broad range of physiological fronts that impact every phase of training performance. So far, we have discussed the neurological and hemodilating power of BLACK POWDER ULTRA - now let's talk stamina.*\r\n\tWe discussed the effects of caffeine as a potent neuromodulators, but did you know that is well-known to also delay fatigue during exercise? According to a recent review article, there is little doubt that caffeine is ergogenic in exercise endurance in situations where fatigue occurs in 30-60 minutes.*xv A meta-analysis of 40 double-blind studies confirmed the ergogenic effects of caffeine — particularly for endurance events.xvi In case you are wondering how this applies to you, \"endurance event\" can be translated, \"marathon training session.\"*\r\n\tNow, to help drive your \"marathon training sessions\" even further, BLACK POWDER ULTRA is formulated with genuine Carnosyn® Beta Alanine as a support factor. Beta alanine is suggested by clinical trials to help delay muscle fatigue and buffer muscle acidosis, which plays a role in physical performance and stamina.* Experimental research indicates carnosine plays a role in the pH buffering capacity of muscle, which suggests its involvement in delaying muscle fatigue.xvii Furthermore, controlled clinical trials suggest that increasing muscle carnosine levels though beta-alanine supplementation can delay neuromuscular fatigue and increase time to exhaustion during cycle ergometry tests.*1\r\n\tIf there was a way to get a jump-start on recovery before a workout was even over, the effects on growth and tomorrow's performance could be staggering. There is a way - it's called BLACK POWDER ULTRA! This powerful pre-workout product was ingeniously formulated to proactively address post-workout recovery efficiency.* One of the key factors that allows for this incredible effect is L-Carnitine, a highly researched amino acid.*\r\n\tOne research group surmised that supplementing with L-Carnitine reduced muscle soreness and markers of muscle damage which play a key role in recovery after resistance exercise.*xviii At least two other trials by the same research group suggested that a twice daily intake L-Carnitine produced favorable responses in reducing muscle soreness, metabolic stress, markers of muscle damage and actual muscle damage, thereby having the potential to influence recovery after resistance exercise.*xix,xx\r\n\tOK, now it's time to fully consider why you want to use a pre-workout product. Of course you want to drive your workout intensity - that's a given. However, the end result that you are really looking for is a chiseled, lean physique. With that in mind, doesn't it make sense to leverage your body's fat-burning potential... during your workout?*\r\n\tBLACK POWDER ULTRA is fully loaded with key ingredients that ignite skeletal muscle bioenergetics. Translation - this formula is designed to help drive fat-to-fuel conversion. Look, why not use some of your own stubborn body fat stores for energy? It's just sitting there, jiggling with every rep and obscuring your hard-earned muscle anyway.*\r\n\tTo see how this works, we need to have another look at Taurine. Preliminary experimental research suggests that taurine can exert blood glucose lowering effects through its ability to improve insulin mediated glucose transport.xxi Researchers have found that taurine controls glucose homeostasis primarily by two mechanisms: by regulating the expression of genes required for the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and by enhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity. This means that Taurine may elicit a type of nutrient partitioning effect by helping to drive circulating glucose to working muscles (not fat cells).*\r\n\tNext, an efficacious dose of Citrus aurantium helps to get fat mobilized for incineration. Technically, this is called lipolysis. Synephrine, one of the primary constituents of Citrus aurantium, has been suggested to activate in vitro lipolysis (i.e., fat breakdown) in human adipocytes via activation of the ß-adrenergic receptor.*xxii\r\n\tOnce lipids are \"loosed\" from their reserves, they are free and \"available\" for transport into the mitochondria for energy production. This is where L-Carnitine comes into play. Carnitine has a well-established role in cellular metabolism, particularly related to its ability to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be oxidized (\"burned\") to produce energy. The relevance of carnitine's role in this process is further confirmed by its high concentration in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that utilize fatty acids as a dietary fuel.xxiii,xxiv Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation appears to be rate-limiting for ATP production from fatty acids in exercising humans.xxv In simple speak - L-Carnitine works as a fat \"transporter\" by helping to move fatty acids into the cellular furnaces (mitochondria) for incineration (energy production).*\r\n\tNow, burning some unwanted body fat for energy is a powerful benefit to be sure. However, we want to be certain that there is plenty of powerful muscle underneath to reveal. Otherwise, you might as well keep that layer of fat. Good news; BLACK POWDER ULTRA is fully equipped to support muscle protein synthesis. One key factor that drives this effect is none other than L-Arginine AKG.*\r\n\tArginine works on two powerful, muscle-building fronts; it is a precursor to creatine and supports muscle protein synthesis.xxvi,xxvii In addition, arginine promotes mTOR/p70s6k activation.xxviii,xxix,xxx Thereby stimulating protein synthesis and enhancing cell migration. An early signaling event activated by amino acids and growth factors in many cell types is the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; FRAP), which is functionally linked to ribosomal protein s6 kinase (p70s6k), a kinase that plays a critical regulatory role in the translation of mRNAs and protein synthesis.xxxi,xxxii That was incredibly technical. Here's a loose translation. First, L-Arginine is a key \"ingredient\" in the production of creatine. Creatine helps to drive muscle power output by quickly \"re-fueling\" ATP during short bursts of intense training. Next, the really technical bit, L-Arginine is a key signaling agent that helps to activate muscle protein synthesis (supports muscle tissue repair and growth).*\r\n\tMRI BLACK POWDER ULTRA delivers everything you demand in a pre-workout product, and more. Never before has MRI engineered such a feat of performance driving perfection. You get a full range of advanced ingredients that drive mental and physical capacity through 7 pathways of performance.*\r\n\tThe MRI BLACK POWDER ULTRA experience engages with a complex of neuromodulators that drive the \"mind-muscle\" connection and intensity. From the moment the workout begins, the formula's impact on muscle energetics, power and strength are evident. As the training continues, key nutrients fuel energy and drive stamina to help you squeeze out more muscle stimulating reps.* You close your session with a deep breath as the last drop of sweat hits the floor, fully confident that your recovery cycle is already engaged.*\r\n\t1 The clinical research reported an improvement in the fatigue threshold, which is equivalent to a delay in muscle fatigue.*"

      "text": "12 hours of continual energy:\r\n\tDexaprine reigns supreme as the king of long lasting energy. It does this through a novel approach to stimulation, which includes a multitude of stimulants to ensure both immediate energy increases as well as all day long energy that just won’t quit.\r\n\tImmediate Stimulation Stimulants found within Dexaprine:\r\n\t1) Citrus Aurantium (30%): Synephrine, N-methyl-Tyramine (2-3 hour half life)\r\n\t2) Acacia Rigidula (98%): Phenylethylamine (and its derivatives/isomers) such as N,N-dimethylphenethylamine, and N,N-dimethyl-A-methylphenethylamine. (30-90 minute half life)\r\n\t3) Caffeine Anyhydrous (4 hour half life)\r\n\tLong Lasting Stimulation Stimulants found within Dexaprine:\r\n\t1) Citrus Aurantium(30%): Methylsynephrine (9 hour half life)\r\n\t2) Green Tea Extract: Theophylline (8-9 hour half life)\r\n\t\r\n\tThis unique combination of stimulants guarantees to have you up and moving within only minutes of your dose, as well as non-stop energy during your entire day. Simply put, Dexaprine won’t stop working until you do!\r\n\tInstant Appetite Suppression:\r\n\tIf you’ve ever dieted, you know the worst part is how hungry you always seem to be. Dexaprine completely eliminates this issue by reducing your appetite so effectively, most users need to actually remind themselves to eat! This incredible effect is present in Dexaprine due to the inclusion of:\r\n\t\r\n\tAcacia Rigidula (98%): This new ingredient not only provides us with endless energy, it also enables us to forget about our hunger for extended periods of time due to naturally occurring amphetamine like compounds found naturally within this potent plant. You thought your fat burner was strong?\r\n\tThese compounds have been found to occur naturally within the Acacia Rigidula plant*:\r\n\t1) Amphetamine 2.\r\n\t2) Methamphetamine\r\n\t3) P-methoxyamphetamine\r\n\tBy incorporating compounds that give us amphetamine like results (intense energy/focus) like those found within the Acacia Rigidula plant (and thus in Dexaprine), you can be assured that any and all hunger pains you normally associate with dieting will be a thing of the past!\r\n\tMassive Mood Enhancement:\r\n\tWhile we all like to diet so we can shed fat and see the amazing physique we’ve worked so hard to achieve, there is no denying that dieting can make most people feel tired, upset, and cranky just about all day long. Dexaprine features a unique mix of novel mood enhancing compounds capable of increasing your brains output of “feel good” chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin.\r\n\tBoth Acacia Rigidula (98%) and Citrus Aurantium (30%) are packed with compounds that not only energize us, but also make our body release copious amounts of these feel good chemicals. These naturally occurring amines/alkaloids will have you feeling awake, excited to attack the day, and ready to handle any roadblock on your way to a thinner you!\r\n\tSpecifically Targets Fat not muscle!\r\n\tEveryone says they want to lose “weight”, however no one really does. The goal is to lose fat, while maintaining our muscle mass. Traditional fat burners help you burn “weight”, which means you’re losing both fat AND muscle. Dexaprine on the other hand uses two specific compounds to ensure maximal fat burning while minimizing muscle loss. In addition to this, one compound in specific not only actively targets fat cells for destruction, but also allows your body to significantly reduce the deposit of fat stores, even in times of calorie surplus/over eating!\r\n\tRauwolfia Serpentina (Standardized for Rauwolscine): \r\n\tThis compound exerts its powerful properties by blocking our Andergenic-2 receptors. By deactivating these receptors, our bodies are forced into a more efficient fat burning process. In addition to burning more fat, Rauwolscine also causes our body to target our fat more efficiently, and focus primarily on visceral fat found within our stomachs, thighs, and butts…all of the hardest places to lose it!\r\n\tIsopropyloctopamine\r\n\tQuite simply…the ULTIMATE fat loss agent. While many fat burners tout claims such as “scientifically proven”, the fact of the matter is that very few ingredients out there have significant proof showing that they can effective burn fat. This compound on the other hand has definitive proof that it not only burns fat, but it does so more effectively than any other compound on the market! Here is a direct quote from a study which looked into its effect on lipolysis (fat loss): “Noteworthy, their common isopropyl derivative, isopropylnorsynephrine (also named isopropyloctopamine…), was clearly lipolytic: active at 1μg/ml”\r\n\tPut simply, this means that even at an insanely small dosage (1mcg/ml) this compound significantly impacted lipolysis or fat loss. Just imagine what it can do at the dose provided in Dexaprine?\r\n\t\r\n\tAccess your tolerance to the power of Dexaprine by taking 1/2 caplet on an empty stomach. After you've accessed your tolerance you may increase your dosing to 1 caplet on an empty stomach immediately upon waking. For only the most extreme athletes, an extract 1/2 serving may be consumed 6-8 hours later. DO not consumer more than 2 capsules in any 24 hour period.\r\n\tNot for use by individuals under the age of 18 years. Keep out of the reach of children.

Hemavol was specifically engineered to generate skin splitting muscle pumps and myofibrallar plasma volumization.\r\n\t\t\tWith Hemavol’s revolutionary hemodynamic technology, your workouts will NEVER be the same! A new generation of plasma volumizers has emerged and Hemavol is the ONLY choice for those who are sick of inferior so called “Nitric Oxide” products packed with useless sugars, caffeine and Arginine. Hemavol uses only ingredients backed by science. It’s time to get one step ahead of the competition, it’s time for Hemavol!\r\n\t \r\n\tiPump. iPower. iPerform.\r\n\tDO YOU?\r\n\tINVINCIBILITY = INCAPABLE OF BEING OVERCOME OR DEFEATED!\r\n\t- State of the art nitric oxide enhancer\r\n\t- Skin splitting pumps & enhanced nutrition delivery\r\n\t- Increased endurance & increased strength\r\n\t\r\n\tThe pump is that feeling of invincibility when you’re in the gym, on the court, or on the field. The pump is produced when the body is flooded with amazing blood surge, extra oxygen, and nutrients, each forcing the muscles to expand! By getting your muscles more oxygen, you are able to train, exercise, and perform at any sport more efficiently. Oxygen helps fuel our muscles with energy, as well as reduce the amount of lactic acid (which makes muscles burn during exercise). Thus, the more oxygen we get to all of our muscles, the longer we are able to work out and play our sport of choice at our absolute peak ability! On top of being able to significantly enhance our endurance, the pump will also provide your muscles with the key nutrients necessary to keep you anabolic while you train or play your sport. When we exercise in any fashion, our body naturally eats away at our own muscle for energy. So, by providing key nutrients like amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and glycogen to our muscles, we can remain in an anabolic (or muscle building) state during the entire exercise period! By flooding the muscles with extra blood, oxygen, and nutrients, you will significantly increase the volume and mass of each muscle cell producing serious increases in power!\r\n\tLAW OF PHYSICS: INCREASE PUMP —› INCREASE POWER\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen your muscles are full, fed with nutrients, and looking great, your body is absolutely primed to experience a massive increase in power! Due to the wonder laws of physics, when we increase the volume and mass of each of our cells (which is exactly what the pump does for us), we automatically increase our amount of power. The more mass an object has, the more “energy” or power it is able to exert. By filling every single one of your muscle cells up with more oxygen, nutrients, and blood, we push these cells’ physical limits to the max, which in turn pushes your potential power output to the max! This means more strength in the weight room, more hitting power on the football field, more kicking power on the soccer field, and even more homerun hitting power on the baseball diamond! When we have more power, every action we do in our sport of choice becomes easier to perform, and forces our competition to realize just how out-matched they truly are!\r\n\tSUPERCHARGE: INCREASE POWER —› INCREASE PERFORMANCE\r\n\t\r\n\tWith your endurance soaring, and your power reaching never before seen heights, your performance in the gym, on the field/diamond/court, is going to amaze you and leave your competitors in the dust. Think about how much better you would be at your sport with more energy, a massive reduction in lactic acid, and more power to supercharge every single one of your motions! Get ready to lift heavier weights, kick the ball further, hit the ball harder, and break through every single plateau you’ve ever been stuck at! To ensure absolute maximum performance, consume 1-2 scoops of Hemavol on an empty stomach with 20oz of water approximately 30 minutes prior to exercise!\r\n\tHemavol is so powerful and so precisely dosed that in order to achieve maximum plasma volumization, it should only be taken on training days and no more than 4 times per week. For best results, drink 12-24 ounces of water with each serving. Consume 1-2 servings (1-2 scoops) approximately 20-30 minutes before your workout.\r\n\tNot for use in people under the age of 18.

But is there anything really new or exciting? Not really. Even though we are a supplement company and have access to every ingredient possible in our lab, we still like to see some innovation out there. We’re a company made up of bodybuilders, martial artists, and athletes from just about every genre.\r\n\tMake no mistake; we still enjoy a good pre-workout just like everyone else. However, most products seem like the same group of ingredients, in a different order, with a different looking label slapped on front. The pre-workout market is becoming a ‘copycat’ league, but we see it as a huge opportunity to drop some real innovation on the market with SUPERDRIVE. We created two new ingredients to make you a believer again in a pre-workout that’s worth your hard earned dollars.\r\n\tSUPERDRIVE Energy:\r\n\tGOING BALLS OUT IS BETTER THAN NO BALLS AT ALL - Arginine alpha keto-glutarate, citrulline, and citrulline malate. Unless you’re a\r\n\tnewbie, you’ve definitely tried these out. All of them, in their own right, served a purpose in supplement history as the foundation for many pre-workouts. If you know supplements then you’ve probably heard of ornithine too. However, you’ve never heard of ornithine malate aka mitoDRIVE. By utilizing ornithine and malic acid with a complex, we uncovered a powerful combination which not only supports endurance and enhances nitric oxide, but also supports recovery and power. It does this by supporting Kreb’s cycle efficiency and reducing ammonia levels within muscle tissue which can cause fatigue. Gaspari Nutrition utilizes a whopping five grams** of mitoDRIVE in SUPERDRIVE to support hyper-performance cellular driven energy.\r\n\tSUPERDRIVE Focus and Stimulation:\r\n\tSTRAP IN, FLIP THE SWITCH, AND GET OUT OF MY WAY- When you want to throw down in the gym, isn’t it nice to have a little mental jolt to get amped? Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine. Caffeine helps release these neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. It’s been shown that certain neurotransmitters can help affect performance and mood, so why not crank them up to help blast through your workout? To further bump up the mental stimulation, SUPERDRIVE contains the new stimulant higenamine which contains a critical component to work in conjunction with n-acetyl tyrosine, DMAE, citrus aurantium, and caffeine to bring your mood to a higher level as you’re blasting though your training session. The focus and stimulation is unrivaled, all with NO CRASH!\r\n\tSUPERDRIVE Pump:\r\n\tDON’T STARE’ DOESN’T APPLY HERE - GLYCEROL is the volumization king, but unfortunately the best types come in liquid form. Acetic acid is the lactic acid buffering king, often used to increase thoroughbred endurance. We asked ourselves “why not reign supreme by combining the two into a muscle volumizing and performance enhancing powerhouse?” This is where GLYCOSPAN technology was born. To get those skin tearing pumps and lactic acid burn-reducing effects in a powder, we developed a special method to microencapsulate liquid triacetin into a powder form. The end result is a super ingredient called GLYCOSPAN, found in SUPERDRIVE. You want to look full blown in rapid time? GLYCOSPAN will get you there.\r\n\tSUPERDRIVE isn’t just another concentrated pre-workout, it’s an effectively dosed pre-workout designed to deliver exactly what you want with pure innovation. It’s something new and exciting in a sea of “me too” products which don’t satisfy your pre-workout needs. SUPERDRIVE achieves its rapid effects at an affordable price and tastes absolutely delicious.\r\n\tWhat more could you want? By utilizing new and revolutionary ingredients such as mitoDRIVE and GLYCOSPAN, SUPERDRIVE is hard hitting and fast acting. Give yourself a dose of liquid motivation on us. We guarantee you’ll be coming back for more because you’ll know right away that SUPERDRIVE is the real deal.Ingredients: Citric acid, natural & artificial flavors, silica, carmine powder (color), sucralose, acesulfame potassium. *These statements have not been evaluated \r\n               by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "text": "ometimes slower is better - especially when it comes to the rate of protein digestion. While rapid protein absorption is desirable immediately before or after exercise, delayed release is probably more beneficial throughout the remainder of the day.\r\n\tCasein proteins are pH sensitive and gel in the acidic environment of the stomach. As a result, it can take more than twice as long for caseins to be broken-down into their amino acid subcomponents than whey and other proteins. Because of their unique time-released qualities, caseins are aptly described as anti-catabolic or muscle-protecting proteins.\r\n\tSLOW-ACTING PROTEIN\r\n\tWhile rapid protein digestion is desirable immediately before or after exercise, slower digestion is more appropriate for between meals and right before bed. Casein proteins are pH sensitive and gel in the acidic environment of the stomach. As a result, it can take longer for caseins to be broken-down into their amino acid subcomponents compared to whey and other proteins. Because of their unique slow-digesting qualities, caseins are accurately described as anti-catabolic or muscle-protecting proteins. ON's Gold Standard 100% Casein was the first all-micellar casein and remains the best seller.\r\n\tUsing a shaker cup is the easiest and most convenient way to mix up a consistently great casein shake every time. Just add one heaping scoop of Gold Standard 100% Casein to a shaker cup filled with 10-12 oz of your preferred beverage. Cover and shake for 25-30 seconds. TIP: Adjust the intensity of your Gold Standard 100% Casein by varying the amount of liquid that your use to prepare it. For a bolder flavor with slightly more body and sweetness, mix 1 heaping scoop with 8-10 oz of water, milk or your favorite beverage. For a milder tasting, less sweet shake, use 12-14 oz of liquid per scoop. Don’t have a shaker cup? Visit optimumnutrition.com and order a custom shaker, or visit your local health food store or gym. BLENDER: Add one heaping scoop of Gold Standard 100% Casein to a blender filled with 10-12 oz of water, milk, or your favorite beverage. Blend for 20-30 seconds. Then add 3-4 ice cubes and blend for an additional 30 seconds. SHAKE UP YOUR SHAKE: By adding a few high-energy ingredients to your shake you can blend up a delicious meal: try adding fresh or frozen fruits (strawberries, bananas, peaches, etc.), peanut butter, flaxseed oil, yogurt, coconut, slivered almond, or other ingredients. STACK YOUR SHAKE: By adding supplements like Micronized Creatine, Glutamine, Taurine, and/or Instantized BCAA powders, you can make Gold Standard 100% Casein an even more powerful recovery product. SPOON STIRRED: If you forgot your shaker cup or don't have time to get out the blender, you can just add one heaping scoop of Gold Standard 100% Casein to a glass filled with 10-12 oz of cold water, milk, or you favorite beverage. Then mix it up with a spoon for about 30 seconds or until powder is dissolved. Suggested Use: Consume approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day through a combination of high protein foods and supplements. For best results, consume your daily protein allotment over several small meals spread even throughout the day. TIP: Try using “slower” Gold Standard 100% Casein with “faster” Gold Standard 100% Whey or Pro Complex at different time for maximum effectiveness .Take Gold Standard 100% casein immediately before bed and in between meals when delayed protein delivery is desired. Drink Gold Standard 100% Whey or Pro Complex proteins before and immediately after workouts for a rapid “shot” of amino acids.\r\n\tNotice: Do not use as sole source of nutrition for weight loss or maintenance.

ISA-TEST GF is now the world's only formula proven to manipulate all three... for total anabolic growth and zero side effects!\r\n\tEven more impressive, here are five undisputed facts that are sure to convince you of the power of Isa-Test GF:\r\n\tISA-TEST Ingredients:\r\n\tTribulus Terrestris (otherwise known as Tribulus or by the active compounds, saponins and protodioscin). Thisherbal extract was originally discovered and researched in Bulgaria(the home of many of today's Olympic Powerlifters). Even though it'sbeen lopped into the same boat as prohormones, it's absolutely,positively not a hormone. In fact, tribulus works with your body—not to inhibit it—but to help support its natural ability to produce T andrestore it to within \"normal\" ranges. Many theorize this is possiblebecause tribulus works by increasing luteinizing hormone (LH), which inturn tells your body to start producing more T. In fact, one study donewith healthy males who supplemented with 750 mg of tribulus per dayshowed a 72% LH increase and an impressive 41% increase in free Tlevels. Another study showed participants had increased libido, sexualbehavior, and sperm production. As a result of these findings, tribulushas become extremely popular and widely accepted as a safe andeffective alternative to prohormones. \r\n\tEurycoma longifolia - Better known by its patented form,Longjax™ - Animal studies have shown significant effects of Eurycomalongifolia on sexual behavior and increases in T—one showing an up to170% increase in T. Another plus is, because Eurycoma isn't aprohormone, it won't suppress your natural production of T: instead itboosts it. In a recent study reported in the 2007 ISSN Journal , 30 menparticipating in a 24-hour mountain biking race were divided into twogroups. One group (15) received Eurycoma, and the other group (15)received a placebo. The researchers measured both cortisol andtestosterone and discovered that the men who used Eurycoma enjoyed32.3% lower cortisol levels and 16.4% higher testosterone. Theyconcluded, \"These results suggest that Eurycoma longifolia extract mayhelp to maintain normal levels of cortisol (low) and testosterone(high) and thus promote an overall 'anabolic' hormonal state duringintense endurance exercise.\" Users on the street have also experiencedfavorable results. It's been noted that 80% of people who use Eurycomanotice an immediate, definite increase in their libido. According tothe science, it appears Eurycoma is a potent stimulator of T levels andsexual arousal and vigor, which really isn't all that bad if you thinkabout it! Currently, there have been no negative side effects reportedfrom the use of Eurycoma. \r\n\tZinc/Magnesium - Zinc Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate -Supported by two studies, this combination of minerals has proven itsworth in the lab and in the real world. It's become apparent for sometime now that consistent resistance training causes a depletion ofvital minerals in the muscle cells. One such critical mineral is zinc.Zinc has also been shown to play an important role in the body'sability to get a restful night's sleep. When you are able to get asound night's sleep, your body releases many more hormones, namely Tand growth hormone—two very powerful anabolic hormones for buildingmuscle mass. In fact, a larger percentage of T secreted daily in menoccurs during sleep, and levels peak during the early morning. As youcan see, a good night's sleep is vitally important for increasing Tlevels, and thus supplementing with zinc can help replace not only the\"depleted\" zinc from weight training but supply the body with adequateamounts for a restful night's sleep... so your T levels can continuallystay on the rise (pardon the pun.) What's more, zinc and magnesiumsupplementation have both been reported to significantly reduce levelsof the catabolic (muscle-wasting) \"stress\" hormone, cortisol, by 59%and 25% respectively.Because zinc and magnesium deficiencies are bothcommonly found in the general public and are even more prevalent inintensely trained athletes and weight trainers, this combination hasbecome popular. I suppose it's also safe to say that because zinc andmagnesium is merely a harmless mineral combination and not aprohormone, it's becoming more and more widely used by competitiveathletes, including college, professional, and Olympian. And with greatsuccess! \r\n\tAjuga   is a traditional folk remedy used in CentralAsia for thousands of years to enhance muscular strength and physicalendurance under harsh, exhausting conditions. \r\n\tRhaponticum is a plant that grows throughout easternSiberia that Soviet scientists used as a replacement for anabolicsteroids. Currently, rhaponticum is listed in the Russian Pharmacopoeiaas a remedy for increasing work efficiency under stressful conditions,improving athletic performance, and promoting recovery after intensemuscular workloads. \r\n\tEpimedium , a lso known as \"horny goat weed,\" is grown asan ornamental herb in Asia and the Mediterranean region. It has beenused for centuries to treat fatigue and boost sex drive. Recent studiesin humans have shown epimedium also decreases cortisol and enhancesimmune function. \r\n\tP-450™ Hesperetin ([(S)-2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-H-1-benzopy-ran-4-one]) is an interesting citrusbio-flavonoid found primarily in oranges and lemons. The antioxidantproperties of hesperetin are fairly well established, and more recentstudies have indicated hesperetin may also have anti-inflammatory,anti-allergic, hypolipidemic (reduces total cholesterol, includingHDL), vasoprotective, and anti-carcinogenic actions. But a newlydiscovered, added benefit of this substance may be even more profoundfor weight trainers since hesperetin appears to be a potentanti-aromatase. See, aromatase is the enzyme that is involved in theprocess through which hormones in the body are converted to Estrogen.As an anti-aromatase, hesperetin reduces the formation of Estrogen inthe body. This is important because the conversion of Testosterone toEstrogen is thought to increase as we age (at least in males), andbecause increases in Estrogen are linked to a whole host of unwantedside effects, like increased bodyfat, testicular shutdown, waterretention, and in extreme cases, even gynecomastia (a\"female-breast-like\" appearance) or testicular cancer. What'sinteresting is that no one has used this powerful anti-Estrogencompound—until recently that is. Probably because hesperetin wasvirtually unknown until recent research indicated its potentialpositive effects for inhibiting Estrogen and because it takes animmense amount of resources to learn how to extract such a compoundfrom its natural source. Recently, however, hesperetin has beentrademarked under the name P-450. Since it's a natural compound and itdoesn't \"shut down\" your body's natural production of T, you can use itfor as long as you'd like. \r\n\tGrapeseed extract is a n extract from red grapescontaining the active compounds known as oligomeric proanthocyanidins(OPC). OPC have potent antioxidant and cardio-protective properties.Recent studies have also shown that OPC have anti-Estrogenic properties. \r\n\tAs a dietary supplement, take 4 capsules with a full glass of water one hour prior to exercise.

To take up more space. To cast a bigger shadow. To create a hulking mound of clay from which to sculpt your masterpiece. Yeah, that’s what it’s all about. You want to be as big as a house, but so often, in taking in the kind of calories necessary to take you to that next level of size, you can get a little pudgy. Sure, adding some bodyfat is a necessity in putting on real deal mass, but after all, you are a bodybuilder—you can’t afford to get sloppy.\r\n\t\r\n\tSo, how does one avoid adding a big belly to that hard earned physique during those offseason bulking months? Clean calories, that’s how. And lots of them. Any stiff can shovel in thousands of empty junk calories and fast food, but it takes a special breed to obtain their calorie surplus from only clean foods. This is what it takes to be a bodybuilder. And it just got a whole lot easier.\r\n\t\r\n\tReal Gains™ from Universal Nutrition is that “x factor” in helping provide your hungry muscles with the quality calories they need, in abundance, to grow like never before. Real Gains™ was designed with the ideal macronutrient profile to provide quality calories in an easily accessible powder form. Real Gains™ can help you build quality… To gain lean muscle, not merely add indiscriminate weight.\r\n\t\r\n\tReal Gains™ is a high calorie, nutritionally-dense weight gainer that consists of a special blend of high quality proteins, complex carbohydrates and essential fatty acids. Starting off with the big daddy of mass building we’ll talk about protein.\r\n\t\r\n\tMost weight gainers on the market use whey protein concentrate for their formulas. Now whey protein concentrate has its benefits, especially for increasing muscle protein synthesis. However because it’s rapidly absorbed you’ll lose its anti-catabolic or muscle sparing effects within 60-90 minutes of ingestion. An ideal protein blend would be to combine a fast absorbing protein along with a time released protein.\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen we formulated Real Gains™, this is exactly what we did. We took whey protein and combined it with premium micellar casein, which rather than being quickly absorbed, provides a steady stream of amino acids in the body. When it comes to protein, Real Gains™ has you covered, combining protein synthesis sparking whey with catabolism fighting casein to create the ultimate mass building blend. One final point: You’ll also find purer, cleaner whey protein isolates in Real Gains™. With other other weight gainers, you might only get economy-minded whey protein concentrate. Think about that.\r\n\t\r\n\tNext up in the Real Gains™ formula are the complex carbohydrates. One of the most important functions that carbohydrates perform is to serve as the main energy source or fuel for the body. Carbohydrates are of primary importance to bodybuilders and other athletes seeking to maximize lean muscle mass. They are \"protein sparing\" which simply means that if you have sufficient carbohydrates present (full glycogen stores), protein will be used primarily for growth and repair. If you do not have sufficient carbohydrates in your system, you may use protein for energy instead of for building muscle.\r\n\t\r\n\tReal Gains™ incorporates a special low DE blend of maltodextrin (a complex carbohydrate) and inulin (a fiber) which helps the growth of healthy intestinal flora, allowing for better nutrient absorption. Maltodextrin contains \"glucose polymers\", which are easier for the body to assimilate and use. Glucose polymers are metabolized at a slow, steady rate that can help to sustain energy levels during endurance-oriented workouts and/or athletic events and support healthy weight gain.\r\n\t\r\n\tInulin is a soluble, non-digestible dietary fiber. Within the small intestine, inulin helps with slowing the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and lipids and promoting nutrient absorption along a greater length of the intestine. This will ensure that you have a steady influx of carbohydrates which will help in balancing blood sugar levels.\r\n\t\r\n\tLast but certainly not least in the mass building equation are fats. Fats are key in hormone synthesis and are the essential component of all cells. The important fats to look into are the essential fatty acids or EFAs for short. EFAs are the crucial fats that your body requires and they make up an integral part of the Real Gains™ formula. The reason why EFAs are so important are that symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency may include fatigue, weakness, slowed growth and the like.\r\n\t\r\n\tLet’s look at the important fats that make up Real Gains™: flaxseed oil and MCTs. Flaxseed oil is one of the best sources of alpha linoleic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid that enhances insulin sensitivity and promotes hormone production as well as myriad benefits for general overall health. MCTs are calorie-dense, healthy fats that contribute to satiety, boost immunity and restrict bodyfat storage. All in all, the fats in Real Gains™ are the healthiest and most anabolic you’re likely to find in a weight gainer.\r\n\t\r\n\tGet familiar with Real Gains™, the new school weight gainer built with old school quality. Exactly what you need to built the bigger, better version of your physique: you, version 2.0. A high quality protein blend, complex carbs and healthy fats come together to give you everything the hard training hardgainer needs to take his physique to a whole new level of mass, density and power. With Real Gains™ from Universal Nutrition size does matter.\r\n\tUse one serving between meals and at bedtime. May also be used to replace one meal per day. This formula is nutrient dense and concentrated, and due to its potency you may want to consider using 1/2 serving two or three times per day. For best results, use a blender or Universal Mix boy with 12 to 16 oz of liquid.\r\n\tKeep out of reach of children.

      "text": "Combat is a high protein sports supplement from MusclePharm. It delivers 140 calories per serving, with 25 grams of time released whey protein.\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT is MusclePharm’s technologically advanced Protein Superfood. Athletes and Bodybuilders have long known that high-quality protein is the key to building and maintaining lean muscle, while supporting a healthy body composition and fueling fat loss. Protein is the most-important macronutrient for muscle growth, mass and power. High quality protein supports muscle growth and recovery and the integrity and health of all body tissues. Active bodies require MORE high quality protein for optimal performance - COMBAT was designed to answer that need.\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT delivers 25 grams of the highest quality PROTEIN BLEND, in a great tasting, easily mixing shake. COMBAT was formulated specifically for athletes and active individuals to support their bodies’ increased protein demands.\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT was carefully formulated using 5 specific proteins, each chosen for their high quality and for their distinct properties. The key protein components in COMBAT™ are precisely combined to cover all the necessary amino acids for optimal growth and recovery, with extra Branched Chain Amino Acids and extra Glutamine to provide maximal growth, recovery and repair. The staggered absorption rate of the 5 different protein components in COMBAT™ guarantees a complete 8-hour nutrient infusion. COMBAT™ is a superior combination of the best protein sources available, combined to keep a steady flow of muscle and power building nutrition flowing into the bloodstream, over up to a full 8 hours!\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT’S Powerful Protein Sources:\r\n\t\t\t• Whey Protein Isolate – Highest available yield of protein, gram for gram, of any whey protein source, WPI is fast absorbing into the muscle tissues, and has immune boosting properties to protect the body system during periods of intense training.\r\n\t\t\t• Partially Hydrolyzed Whey Protein – Hydrolyzed whey is protein that’s been broken down into fast-absorbing peptides. The fastest absorbing of all forms of whey, hydrolyzed whey hits the bloodstream first, providing a rapid infusion of muscle building amino acids.\r\n\t\t\t• Micellar Casein – very slow-digesting, micellar casein has the capability of slowly infusing amino acids over several hours, protecting muscle tissue from breakdown over time. There is no substitute for the anti-catabolic effects of micellar casein.\r\n\t\t\t• Whey Protein Concentrate – closer to the whole food sources than other whey proteins, concentrate contains real food subfractions such as alpha-lactoglobulins and lactoferrins, with specific immune boosting and muscle building properties.\r\n\t\t\t• Egg Albumin – High bio-availability and well tolerated by most individuals, egg albumin has a high BCAA content and arginine. Egg albumin is a powerful contributor to hormone production and the muscle building process.\r\n\t\t\tDigestive Enzyme Blend:\r\n\t\t\tDigestive enzymes break down food along the digestive tract so that nutrients can be absorbed into the bloodstream. COMBAT™ contains 60mg of a Digestive Enzyme Blend to aid in the digestion and absorption of the key muscle-building proteins contained herein. The body cannot absorb what it cannot break down. The added Digestive Enzyme Blend ensures maximum utilization of COMBAT’s muscle-building protein component.\r\n\t\t\tAdded BCAAs and Glutamine:\r\n\t\t\tThe Branched Chain Amino Acids, L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Valine, are the most critical of the essential amino acids for the maintenance, repair and building of muscle tissue. The BCAA’s (especially L-Leucine) have been shown to stimulate protein synthesis and therefore, muscle growth. BCAA’s may also slow down catabolism by inhibiting cortisol. L-Glutamine is the amino acid that has immune-boosting properties. L-Glutamine helps with recovery as well. Together, the extra Branched Chain Amino Acids and the added Glutamine in COMBAT fortify the muscle-building, recovery and immune-boosting properties of this, the most technologically advanced protein super food available.\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT feeds the anabolic and recovery pathways within the body to support muscle growth, fuel recovery and maximize the body’s adaptive response to hard training.\r\n\t\t\tNO HARD-TRAINING ATHLETE SHOULD TRAIN WITHOUT COMBAT.\r\n\t\t\tWhat Is Combat Powder?\r\n\t\t\tWith a precision-engineered matrix that contains whey protein concentrates, hydrolysates, and solates, as well as egg albumin and micellar casein, COMBAT is the ultimate timed-released protein super-food! Because each of the distinct protein sources found within COMBAT digest at varying rates,amino acids are not only flooded into the bloodstream within minutes after consumption, but will continuously be \"trickle fed\" to your muscles for up to 8 hours afterward!\r\n\t\t\tWhen is the best time to use Combat?\r\n\t\t\tCertainly the most important times are immediately upon awakening, right after training, and justbefore bed, as these are vital periods for the initiation of the growth process. However, Combat can also be used at ANY time of day as a substitute for whole food protein.\r\n\t\t\tWhy not use just whey protein? Isn’t that the best source of protein?\r\n\t\t\tWhile whey is one of the most important protein sources on the planet, it has its limitations, and thus works best as part of a blend of proteins. You see, whey protein is digested very quickly, which causes a rapid rise in blood amino acids. While this seems like a great thing, there remains a problem. These amino acids are cleared from the system almost immediately, which is excellent for the short term, but does not cover the period of time between meals. However, with the addition of egg albumin and micellar casein you will slowly trickle feed amino acids to your cells over a period of up to 8 hours! This makes COMBAT the ultimate anabolic andanticatabolic protein matrix!\r\n\t\t\tWill COMBAT mess up my stomach?\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT contains some of the best, and purest proteins currently available and is very low in lactose. Additionally, a special digestive blend has been added to the formula to promote better digestion and assimilation of the protein constituents. For most, COMBAT provides no stomach discomfort whatsoever.\r\n\t\t\tShould COMBAT be mixed with milk or water?\r\n\t\t\tCOMBAT protein can be mixed with either depending on your tastes and goals. A thicker and richer shake will be had with the use of milk, but it is recommended for those that are bulking up. For those looking to gain lean muscle and/or reveal more definition, either straight water or ½ skim milk and ½ water is recommend. COMBAT tastes great either way.\r\n\t\t\tCan COMBAT be used in conjunction with other Muscle Pharm products?\r\n\t\t\tAbsolutely it can! COMBAT is a perfect fit with any and all of the Muscle Pharm line of hardcore products! In fact, COMBAT should be the foundation of your supplement program no matter what your fitness goals entail.\r\n\t\t\tSince protein already contains both glutamine and BCAA’s, why is there more added to the formula? \r\n\t\t\tBCAA’s and glutamine are the most important amino acids for muscle growth and repair, mostly because of the roles they play in protein synthesis, immune system function, energy production,glycogen storage, natural GH release, and the slowing of protein breakdown. Thus, we added even more of these amazing aminos so that your results would surpass anything you have experienced with any other protein powder!\r\n\t\t\tWhat really sets COMBAT apart from the rest of the protein formulas out there?\r\n\t\t\tWell, aside from COMBAT’s incredible protein matrix…its easy mixability…its fantastic taste…and the added BCAA’s, glutamine and digestive complex, what really makes COMBAT special is the fact that OMEGA WAVE technology was utilized to “precision formulate” the product (as well as the entire Muscle Pharm line) to be the most effective of its kind. OMEGA WAVE technology is used to monitor the function of multiple biological systems and provide a comprehensive picture of changes in athletes, as they respond to training, life choices, and emotional stress, diets and supplementation.

      "text": "Raspberry ketones\r\n\t\r\n\tRaspberry Ketones with Green Tea, L-Carnitine\r\n\tRaspberry ketones are found in raspberries and significantly aid in weight loss. Raspberry ketones block fat by encouraging the body to use fat instead of storing it. Raspberry ketones encourage hormones that metabolize fats for energy. Raspberry ketones help suppress the appetite and aid in the breakdown of fat molecules to be used for fat metabolism.\r\n\t\r\n\tRaspberry Ketones - Functions & Usages\r\n\t\r\n\tThe molecular structure or RK is similar to capsaicin and synephrine, which are thermogenic. Research showed that RK prevented from obesity and an increase in blood triglyceride in mice even when the animals were on a high-fat diet. Therefore, RK functions to prevent from obesity and fat storage.\r\n\t\r\n\tRaspberries contain significant amounts of polyphenol antioxidants, which are linked to promoting endothelial and cardiovascular health. This fruit ranks near the top of all fruits for antioxidant strength due to their high contents of ellagic acid (from ellagotannins), quercetin, gallic acid, anthocyanins, cyanidins, pelargonidins, catechins, kaempferol and salicylic acid. They are considered as a high-fiber food and are an excellent source of vitamin A, B vitamins 1-3, iron, calcium, potassium, vitamin C, manganese, vitamin K and magnesium.\r\n\t\r\n\tRaspberry ketones help prevent and improve various health conditions.\r\n\t\r\n\tSuch as obesity, cellulite, skin looseness and fluid retention. They offer lots of fiber and antioxidants with very few calories, making them very \"dense\" nutritionally. Raspberry ketones help the efficiency of your metabolism by increasing the body’s core temperature and in so doing increasing the body’s fat burning abilities. Raspberry ketones also help reduce the amount of dietary fat absorbed by the body.\r\n\t\r\n\tGreen Tea\r\n\t\r\n\tGreen Tea is an excellent aid to weight loss regimens. Green Tea lowers cholesterol, increases thermogenesis (the body's rate of burning calories), and enhances fat oxidation. It contains high concentrations of catechin polyphenols. These compounds work with other chemicals to intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis, where heat is created in the body by burning fuels such as fat. It lowers cholesterol and increases energy expenditure. Green tea also causes carbohydrates to be released slowly, preventing sharp increases in blood-insulin levels.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis promotes the burning of fat. Green tea users have reported feeling satisfied with smaller quantities of food, achieving the “full” feeling sooner. Green tea catechins can help prevent obesity by inhibiting the movement of glucose in fat cells.\r\n\t\r\n\tGreen tea kicks up your metabolism.\r\n\t\r\n\tA study reported on in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that green tea extract resulted in a significant increase in energy expenditure (a metabolism 'boost'). The researchers also concluded that that over a 24-hour period, green tea extract increases the metabolic rate by 4%. 2) Green tea inhibits fat absorption and helps glucose regulation. The catechins in green tea help to inhibit the movement of glucose into fat cells. Green tea also acts as al glucose regulator. It helps to slow the rise in blood sugar after a meal. This prevents high insulin spikes (lots of insulin promotes fat storage) and the subsequent fat storage. Green tea has been linked to the reeducation of appetite.\r\n\t\r\n\tOverall, Green Tea helps you with weight loss\r\n\t\r\n\tBy boosting your metabolic rate, regulating your blood sugar, and suppressing your appetite. THEOBROMINE The powerful appetite-suppressing effect of theobromine results in less calorie intake.\r\n\t\r\n\tTheobromine\r\n\t\r\n\tAlso known as xantheose, is a colorless alkaloid of the cacao plant that is bitter in taste.\r\n\t\r\n\tTheobromine is related to caffeine, but does not stimulate the central nervous system\r\n\t\r\n\tBut the difference lies in the number of methyl groups. It has three methyl groups, unlike caffeine that has just two methyl groups. The additional methyl group of the theobromine increases its half-life and reduces its clearance from the body so its effects last longer. Theobromine has the ability to stay in the body for a long time. About half of what is consumed will take seven to eight hours to pass through, allowing more active time in the body. Theobromine has similar effects to caffeine, but it does not stimulate the central nervous system and so does not produce the jitters often associated with diet pills. Alternatively, theobromine promotes muscular relaxation.\r\n\t\r\n\tTheobromine is a mild stimulant and diuretic.\r\n\t\r\n\tIts diuretic properties have shown in clinical studies to reduce food intake. This can aid weight loss by giving you a little energy boost for physical activity and helping you shed water weight.\r\n\t\r\n\tTheobromine possesses thermogenic properties\r\n\t\r\n\tWhich increases metabolism that will burn off those stubborn fatty deposits. Whenever body temperature is increased, it stimulates metabolism, and the fat cells are broken down and utilized as energy to support this increased metabolic rate. As a powerful antioxidant, theobromine contains added health benefits. It induces a rejuvenating boost unparallel to other supplements that provides to be an effective mood stabilizer.\r\n\t\r\n\tTheobromine manages to increase alertness\r\n\t\r\n\tSo you don’t feel a crash throughout the day without produces jitters, anxiety, dizziness, or headaches.\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine assists in the transport of long-chained fatty acids that are burned for energy. It enhances the consumption of fat as a source of fuel.\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine has also been shown to increase the amount of fat you burn\r\n\t\r\n\tDuring both anaerobic (strength training) and aerobic (cardiovascular) workouts. It plays an important role in mobilizing fatty deposits found in tissues of overweight individuals.\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine helps remove fats waste products (ketones) from the blood stream\r\n\t\r\n\tEffective carnitine activity helps to discourage fatty build up in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle.\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine has been shown to improve lean muscle strength\r\n\t\r\n\tMaintaining muscle tissue takes four to five times more calories than maintaining fat tissue, which is important for permanent weight loss. L-Carnitine helps to stabilize blood sugar and eliminate cravings for carbohydrates.\r\n\t\r\n\tOverall,L-Carnitine directly increases fat burning, Decreases food cravings, and enhances energy levels which motivate patients to exercise more.\r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n\t "

What does this mean for you? You're consuming the absolute highest quality protein on the market, fuelling your body with the most biologically advanced amino's proven for muscular growth and development.\r\n\tVPX is proud to bring you a cutting edge NEW Whey Protein Isolate called, SpiroFuse Reverse Osmosis™ or SRO™! This invention is Whey Protein Isolate by Reverse Osmosis SpiroFuse Filtration™ or SRO™. Roughly 10 years ago VPX was the first company ever to release a ceramic filtered Whey Protein Isolate called cross flow microfiltration. This created quite a stir in the supplement industry because until that time, only whey protein concentrate (WPC) or low grade Ion Exchange WPI was available. As you can imagine there have been significant improvements in protein technology over the past 10 years. As a result of these superior scientific advancements, VPX is utilizing super high tech new membrane systems that produce isolated proteins that are 99%+ pure and are ultra rich in potent low molecular weight micro-fractions (LMWF). The SRO™ ZERO CARB flavoring system is also NEW and developed by VPX flavor experts solely for your enjoyment. These new SRO™ potent proteins and flavor technologies are only available inside SRO™ ZERO CARB® Protein, Syngex® Protein and other VPX protein products. VPX is creating the future of muscle science, bodybuilding and performance enhancement to allow you to achieve your fitness goals!\r\n\t\r\n\tThe most consistent and effective way to lose weight and unwanted body fat is by consuming a high protein/low carbohydrate diet (with moderate dietary fat intake). This is primarily due to the fact that protein has a spectacular three-phase assault on body fat: 1) protein causes the body to release a hormone called glucagon that frees up stored body fat to be used as energy, 2) protein builds muscle tissue and fat is burned inside of the muscle cell; consequently, more muscle equals greater fat burning capacity, and 3) to digest protein, the body has to expend a great deal of heat: this process is called the “thermic effect” of protein and results in the body burning additional calories even at rest.\r\n\t\r\n\tWhile it is true that one of the keys to losing weight is to expend more calories than we consume, the most important secret for long term fat and weight loss is to control the hormone insulin. Insulin release is consistent with the amount and/or type of carbohydrates we consume. This hormone also causes our body to store fat and can prevent stored body fat from being utilized as energy. However, if we control insulin with a low carbohydrate diet, we also reduce our body weight and body fat. SRO™ ZERO CARB® Protein is the Carbohydrate-Free King of Proteins™ and can be utilized to supplement any type of low-carb diet. Many of the most successful weight loss programs have been based on low carbohydrate/high protein diets. Protein is unquestionably the single most important nutrient for dramatically redefining and improving your physique, and SRO™ ZERO CARB® Protein is the highest quality fat and carbohydrate-free protein supplement available. Do what many of the greatest professional athletes, bodybuilders and movie stars have done and make VPX® an integral part of your supplementation program today!\r\n\tFor a great tasting, delicious shake combine each scoop of Zero Carb Protein with 4-6 ounces of cold water (depending on personal preference for desired thickness). For added body blend two or three ice cubes with Zero Carb. Use 2-3 servings daily. Always drink 12 to 16 ounces of additional water for each protein shake consumed.\r\n\tIngredients derived from milk and soy(as soy lecithin). Zero Carb does not contain soy protein.

      "text": "Product Features:\r\n\tANY SPORT, ANY TIME\r\n\tMORE TESTOSTERONE = MORE GAINS\r\n\tTestosterone is the key deciding factor in how much muscle you can gain. Too little testosterone, and no matter how well you eat, no matter how hard you train, and no matter how much you wish it would happen, you just won’t grow. Testosterone is what separates boys from men, and odds are that your testosterone is lower now than it has been since before you hit puberty. That means there is only one solution to adding slabs of lean, hard, and dense muscle to your frame, and that is MORE testosterone. The most effective way to enhance your testosterone to super-human limits is to use Tropinol XP™, the most advanced testosterone booster ever created.\r\n\tEVERY SINGLE ANGLE IS COVERED!\r\n\tTropinol XP™ is the one testosterone booster on the market that focuses on using only clinically proven compounds to ensure that your testosterone is raised higher than ever before, and that you can actually FEEL the extra testosterone coursing through your body. Having a massive increase in testosterone can give users a huge increase in libido, alpha-male mentality, workout intensity & endurance, serious size and strength gains, and even provides a massive pump unlike anything you’ve ever experienced before!\r\n\tUNLOCKING YOUR GROWTH POTENTIAL\r\n\tTestosterone works by floating through our blood stream, and coming in contact and connecting with Androgen Receptors. Androgen Receptors are similar to a lock in a door, in that they sit there and do nothing until a key is used to either lock or unlock them. In this instance, testosterone is the key and its purpose is to unlock the Androgen Receptor. By “unlocking” or activating our Androgen Receptors with testosterone, we send a signal to our brain that it is time to GROW. The more androgen receptors you have “unlocked”, the stronger the signal to the brain, and the stronger the growth signal will be to your muscles.\r\n\tiForce Nutrition just released the strongest all natural product the world has ever seen. It is the ONLY natural product that can raise testosterone levels into the supra-physiological level. That's right. It's the ONLY one. Stop wasting your time on a product that boasts a measly 42% increase in testosterone, and use one that actual works!\r\n\t\r\n\tThis product has been in the works almost an entire year, and after countless hours spent on research and development, iForce is confident we are years ahead of our time, and we will all see pigs flying before a stronger natural product is created.\r\n\tNOTHING LIKE IT HAS EVER BEEN MADE!\r\n\tWith this in mind, it would seem to make sense that a testosterone booster would not only increase how much testosterone we have in our body, but would also find a way to activate more Androgen Receptors, as well as making every single Androgen Receptor more sensitive. While this may seem logical, no formula has ever been able to accomplish this until now! Tropinol XP™ will flood your body with INSANE amounts of testosterone, while simultaneously sensitizing, and activating every single Androgen Receptor physically possible. This potent combination is a 1-2 punch that will deliver IMMEDIATE results.\r\n\tFEEL THE SURGE!\r\n\tImagine raising your testosterone level so high that you can actually FEEL the surge as it rushes through your veins. This cascade of hormonal overload will enable you to up your intensity and endurance on your very first dose! No longer do you have to wait the typical 4-6 weeks for a testosterone booster to start showing any sort of effects, as Tropinol XP™ will have you pushing out more reps, with higher weights instantaneously. By harnessing the power of our bodies natural cellular signaling mechanisms, Tropinol XP™ will provide your muscles with additional blood, oxygen, and nutrients to ensure that every single workout causes your body to be pushed to the absolute max, resulting in the quickest gains in size and strength you have ever experienced.\r\n\tDRY UP AND LEAN OUT!\r\n\tWhen our testosterone is absolutely maxed out, our libido is at its highest in years, and our muscles are primed and full it’s important to LOOK as good as we feel! Tropinol XP™ ensures that you will not only feel amazing, but you will look your best as well. Through the use of key compounds, Tropinol XP™ will force your body to release stubborn water stores to help give you that dry and lean look that every athlete desires. This means your muscles will show more definition, you’ll lose useless body weight, and be able to literally WATCH as your body transforms right in front of your eyes!\r\n\tPUT IT TO THE TEST!\r\n\tNever settle for anything less than the absolute best. Tropinol XP™ contains the most tried and true ingredients ever put together in a testosterone booster, and will work so well you can actually FEEL the insane increase in testosterone as is surges through your body. Just 1 dose to feel the magic…imagine what you’ll feel in 30 days?!?\r\n\tWorkout Days: On workout days, consume 4 servings (4 capsules) of Tropinol XP approximately 30-60 minutes pre-workout. Non Workout Days: On non-workout days, consume 2 servings (2 capsules) upon waking, and an additional 2 servings (2 capsules) approximately 6-8 hours later. Do not use Tropinol XP for longer than 8 continuous weeks without a 4 week break afterward.

Stimulate, feed, grow, and do it again the next day. To maximize mass, strength and speed, nothing nurtures growth and recovery, nothing primes the body for the next day's battle like Bullet Proof.\r\n\tBullet Proof is one of the Best Choice for Athlets when it comes to recovery and Sleep Support:\r\n\tF.A.Q.\r\n\tWhat is Bullet Proof? \r\n\tBullet Proof is an advanced nighttime recovery formula. Bullet Proof will aid you in depp restfull sleep which is very important for Muscle Growth, enhanced recovery and muscle repair, and increased stimulation of natural HGH levels.\r\n\tShould Bullet Proof Be cycled?\r\n\tTo get the maximum benefits of Bullet Proof we recommended cycling the product so that you body does not build a tolerance to the Nootropic ingredients in Bullet Proof. Bullet Proof can be used two ways:\r\n\t\r\n\t(1) During extra hard training periods or contest prep Bullet Proof can be used everyday for for 22 days straight. After the 22 days you should cease usage for two weeks before starting another cycle of Bullet Proof.\r\n\t(2) Alternatively Bullet Proof can be cycled by using a 5 days on 2 days of regiment. With this dosing scheme you can use Bullet Proof for up to 8 weeks before needing to take a two week break from the product. Optimally you would want to take Bullet Proof on Your workout days and not use it on your off days from training.\r\n\tCan Bullet Proof be taken with a before bed shake?\r\n\tWe recommend not mixing Bullet Proof with a pre-bed meal or shake. The ingredients in Bullet Proof synergistically work together to optimize your hormones while sleeping and keep your body in an  state. Bullet Proof delivers all the essential nutrients need to optimize your body’s ability to recover from training therefore a shake or meal before bed is not necessary. Also meals high in calcium may hinder the absorption of some of the ingredients in Bullet Proof which will greatly take away from Bullet Proofs increased recovery capabilities.\r\n\t\r\n\tShould I dose Bullet Proof on an empty stomach?\r\n\tTo get the maximum benefits of Bullet Proof we recommend taking the product with an empty stomach. Bullet Proof works by increasing the amount of two vital hormones in the body, Testosterone and Growth Hormone. Growth hormone will not be released if another hormone, insulin, is present in the body. To make sure Insulin levels are low you should dose Bullet Proof at least 1 hour after a meal containing carbohydrates, or optimally two hours which will create an even better environment for the body to absorb the ingredients in Bullet Proof.\r\n\tShould I drink Bullet proof during workouts, Preworkout or Any Other Time of Day?\r\n\tAlthough Bullet Proof contains many ingredients that are very productive when taking around training times, its also contains ingredients that with strongly relax the body and induce sleep. Therefore it is not recommended to take Bullet Proof before a workout or during the day, but as a night time recovery aid.\r\n\tThe ingredients in Bullet Proof will rapidly induce the body to enter a relaxed state, therefore causing users to become very sleepy. Therefore it is important that you DO Not operate machinery or a vehicle after dosing Bullet Proof.\r\n\tWill Bullet Proof help me fall asleep faster?\r\n\tYes! The ingredients in Bullet Proof have been scientifically proven to not only induce deeper and more restful sleep, but also to relax the body and mind while still awake. Shortly after dosing Bullet Proof users will notice a very relaxing and calming feeling taking over there body which will lead to users falling asleep anywhere from 30 – 60 minutes later.\r\n\tIs Bullet Proof safe for both Men and Women?\r\n\tYes, the ingredients in Bullet Proof are safe for any adult with out pre-existing medical conditions. Both males and females will receive enhanced recover and more restful sleep while using Bullet Proof.\r\n\tWill Bullet Proof help me if I use stimulants late at night?\r\n\tAlthough it is not recommended to use stimulants within 6 hours of sleep, the ingredients in Bullet Proof may help negate the effects of stimulants that have been taken within 3-4 hours before bed.\r\n\tWhy is sleep Crucial to a bodybuilder/athlete?\r\n\tContrary to popular belief, athletes and bodybuilders do not build muscle in the gym but they actually build it while sleeping. When training you cause micro tears in your muscle fibers that trigger the body to repair and strengthen itself so that you can become stronger and adapt to your training. The catch is though, that the body will only repair itself while you are at rest. Also while you sleep you are allowing your body’s central nervous system to refresh itself and prepare your body for future training. Without proper rest an athlete will never fully recover from their training and will eventually not be able to progress to more intense and productive training sessions. Bullet Proof will help you to deep sleep so that your muscle can grow and it will also shorten the span of recovery. While in deep sleep your body will produce its most  hormones, Testosterone and Growth Hormone. These two hormones greatly influence your body composition and athletic ability which will allow you to achieve your goals not only faster, but also naturally.\r\n\tTake 1 scoop with 10-12 oz. of water 30-45 minutes prior to bedtime. Cycle 5 days on, 2 days off. For optimal results 8 hours of sleep is suggested.\r\n\tThis product is only intended to be consumed by healthy adults 18 years of age or older.

Formulated with premium ingredients such as Leucine Nitrate and Neuro-peptide Alpha, it's radically different from any other pre-workout you have tried.\r\n\t\t\tSuperSize gives intense energy and focus without using the same common ingredients found in many popular formulas. Two new powerful stimulants and the muscle building Nitric Oxide precursor Leucine Nitrate utilize different biochemical pathways that your body is not adapted to. This ensures a great workout with just one dose.\r\n\t\t\tThe proven muscle building amino acid Luecine is bonded with the powerful NO precursor called Nitrate. This is an advanced compound that encourages muscle growth, fights muscle breakdown and gives long lasting muscle pumps. Much longer lasting than typical Arginine based pre-workouts.\r\n\t\t\tSuperSize's unique stimulants deliver a brand new kind of energy we like to call \"Clear and Focused\". Your mind is focused, clear of distraction and staying on task is easy. With more energy and focus than than you thought possible from a supplement you will get that extra rep or complete that last set every time.\r\n\t\t\tSuperSize was developed for athletes who want properly dosed stimulants combined with proven muscle building ingredients. These compounds maximize intra-workout energy levels and prevent muscle breakdown and fatigue.\r\n\t\t\tYou will notice fast acting focused energy and stimulation so you can get a great workout. Leucine Nitrate is also working with your body's natural bio-mechanisms to fight muscle breakdown and produce a ton of Nitric Oxide. This relaxes and volumizes the blood vessels to rush oxygen and vital nutrients to your muscles so they can grow and repair as well as give you a more pumped up look and feel.\r\n\t\t\tAt the core, SuperSize was formulated with all new stimulants that act on different biochemical pathways in the body. This fights your body's adaptation to other pre-workouts and gives you a powerful workout with the very first serving. Combining P-Phenethylbenzamide, a plant extract that the body converts to a powerful stimulant of the central nervous system, with a NeuroPeptide Alpha (brain stimulant) allows SuperSize to produce a stimulated feeling with a highly focused attitude to better prepare you for an intense workout.\r\n\t\t\tLeucine Nitrate uses the reverse nitric oxide pathway to produce significantly more Nitric Oxide for much longer time than the classic L-Arginine N.O. Synthase pathway that many supplements use. The enhanced Nitric Oxide environment in your body grows and repairs muscle for up to 8 hours, plus has that very nice \"Pump\" benefit that makes your muscle look and feel bigger by filling them with additional blood.\r\n\t\t\tAs a dietary supplement, take 1-3 scoops with 8 ounces of cold water and consume 30-45 minutes before beginning activity. Due to the potency of this pre-workout product, it's highly recommended to assess tolerance by using a 1 scoop serving. Some individuals may find 1, 2 or 3 scoops per serving is the ideal dose for Maximum Energy, Strength, and Training Power. Do Not Exceed 4 Scoops In Any 24 Hour Period.\r\n\t\t\tRead Entire Label Prior To Use. This product is only intended to be consumed by healthy adults 18 years of age or older.

      "text": "The Ultimate Pre-Workout Intensity Muscle Builder\r\n\tOver the years, SuperPump has been the \"must have\" pre-workout for serious lifters around the world. From original SuperPump250 to SuperPump MAX, Gaspari Nutrition's pre-workouts deliver results in record time. Staying on top of research trends, but remaining true to Rich Gaspari's core belief in creating hard hitting products, SuperPump 3.0 is the newest evolution of the SuperPump legacy featuring a mind blowing list of classic ingredients in powerful doses and new ingredients such as inositol arginine silicate .\r\n\t\r\n\tThere's a reason this is called the ultimate pre-workout intensity muscle builder and it was just too good to hide behind a proprietary blend. You want get bigger? You want to train harder? You want to recover faster? SuperPump 3.0 is the answer.\r\n\t \r\n\tReal innovation these days is hard to come by but fortunately Gaspari R&D was able to get their hands on this revolutionary form of clinically studied patented arginine called inositol arginine silicate (aka Nitrosigine). By itself, arginine has a poor bioavailability when taken orally due to enzymes called arginases which break it down. By attaching inositol and silicon to the molecule, it’s able to avoid a high degree of degradation and increase blood vessel relaxation 5x greater than arginine hcl and increase blood flow almost 2x greater in animal models.\r\n\t\r\n\tA little known facts to most athletes is that the mineral silicon serves an important role in your cardiovascular system as a host of other benefits throughout the body. Silicon has been shown to a be a critical component to arterial wall strength and integrity. In the case of Nitrosigine, the silicon component helps increase blood levels greatly which may assist increased blood flow observed when taking pre-training.\r\n\t\r\n\tAdditionally, human trials have looked at the effects of Nitrosigine on proteomics. The study found that Nitrosigine positively affected certain proteins that are associated with cardiovascular health, including vasodilation. This powerful ingredients helps drive the “pump” in SuperPump to levels never seen before and in ways which were once thought not possible.\r\n\t \r\n\tThis novel arginine derivative was specifically spec’d into the SuperPump 3.0 by Rich Gaspari himself. These reason being, its elicits extremely strong pumps. It works by binding to the alpha2-adrenergic and imidazole receptors of endothelial cells increasing nitric oxide (NO) production which may assist in volumizing blood vessels. Agmatine has become one of the must have “pump agents” in many pre-workouts. However, it is also extremely expensive but Rich is a man of his word and wants to put out solid products which is why we use 500 mg per serving.\r\n\t \r\n\tOne great thing about Gaspari Nutrition is that we listen to our customers. We surveyed a group from Gaspari Nation and overwhelmingly 80% of them said they wanted beta-alanine in a pre-workout from us. You really can’t argue with that or the science, so we added a whopping dose of beta-alanine to every scoop of SuperPump 3.0. The science is very clear. Beta-alanine helps increase the buffering capacity of working muscle, fights off acidosis, delays fatigue, and increases endurance capacity. Why wouldn’t you want an effective dose of beta-alanine in your pre-workout? You asked, and we listened.\r\n\t \r\n\tBCAA’s are by far some of the best ingredients athletes have available to them to increase recovery support lean body mass, and limit delayed onset muscular soreness. Free form BCAA’s are proven to increase recovery levels when taken prior to training. We included clinically studied levels of them in our formula and to help reduce potential catabolism and soreness as you push yourself through your grueling workouts. Recovery is paramount to optimal performance and we are one of the few brands using hefty doses of BCAA’s in our pre-workout because you demanded it.\r\n\t \r\n\tOver the years, how many forms of creative have we seen touted as the next big thing? The reality is, none of them have the amount of research supporting their use in athletes and bodybuilders as Creapure creatine monohydrate. We use this in SuperPump 3.0 specifically to help increase strength and power. Creatine monohydrate supports this by increasing phosphocreatine levels in skeletal muscle. When phosphocreatine stores are increased it allows for more ADP to be regenerated into ATP which supplies energy to working muscle for exercise and power. Creapure has stood the test of time for a reason. It’s one of the most safe and effective ergogenic aides ever created.\r\n\t \r\n\tCholine itself has a wealth of health and wellness benefits but we use it in SuperPump 3.0 for a few key reasons. Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter involved numerous process involving exercise but one of the most important is that is involved in skeletal muscle innervation and muscle control. The second important factor is also related to acetylcholine fatigue and increase vigor during strenuous exercise. In the SuperPump 3.0 formula, it helps create a balanced stimulant “feel” so you can train harder and longer.\r\n\t \r\n\tWhen coming up with such an advanced formula, we wanted to make sure many of the natural components have optimal absorption. Bioperine is the “must have” bioavailability enhancer in the supplement world and we use the clinically researched dose in every scoop of SuperPump. It’s a highly potent extract of Piper nigrum which is standardized for a component called piperine.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis revolutionary compound enhances bioavailability this by interacting with the ultrastructure of intestinal brush border and stimulating digestive enzymes. In various animal models piperine has been shown to enhance the bioavailability of branch chain amino acids and vitamin B6.\r\n\t \r\n\tCaffeine has been scientifically shown to enhance energy and thermogenesis. Clinical research has also shown it enhances athletic activity which supports its use in many sports nutrition pre-workout products. Newer research has demonstrated that caffeine not only supports high output exercise but also endurance. SuperPump 3.0 uses the widely studied anhydrous form of caffeine which many research studies have utilized when testing performance in athletes. Since SuperPump is designed for athletes and bodybuilders from all walks of life, it was the perfect fit for this masterful formula.\r\n\t "

      "text": "RAPID PERFORMANCE & RECOVERY SUPERCARB\r\n\tJust The Facts:\r\n\tTHE KEY TO FASTER GASTIC CLEARANCE (AKA EMPTYING YOUR STOMACH)\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen you are working out, what is the worst thing that can happen after you take a few sips of water or any other intraworkout drink? Cramps. Nothing can kill a workout faster than some rib thumping cramps. Because of this, intelligently formulated 'sports drinks should have a verified osmolarity which is a key indicator of how fast it can clear the stomach, thus potentially avoiding cramps.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Gaspari Nutrition R&D Team is acutely aware of this which is why they developed Osm Technology. This 'new way' of looking at carbohydrate drinks utilizes a proprietary method of tuning the electrolytes in solution with pure cyclic dextrin to get an optimal osmolality (mOsm). Remember, lower osmolality = faster gastric clearance.\r\n\t\r\n\tTo be real, we knew full well we had to have a lower osmolarity than our competition. So, we spent the money and had our entire competitor products tested at a 3rd party laboratory to see where we stood. With some fine tuning using Osm Technology, Glycofuse is confirmed to have an outstanding osmolality compared to just about every product on the market, including the biggest brands out there. They can't hide from the facts.\r\n\tIf you're a 'carbo-phobe' then you really aren't concerned with performance, recovery, or lean muscle. True Athletes understand the importance of carbohydrates and embrace them. Whether they are carb-loading before a competition, rolling on the mat, banging out a WOD, slamming a drink during a race, or refueling after a tough training session they know that in order to get to where they want to be they need the energy to get there. Glycogen is what helps fuel your workouts and keep muscles volumized. There is no way around that!\r\n\t\r\n\tHere's the reality of the situation. Not all carbs are created equal. There's a lot of cleverly labeled and modified maltodextrin on the market claiming to be some technical polysaccharide. Or, there's plain old cornstarch relabeled as super-duper muscle engorging waxy maize. Most of these aren't proven to do anything except deliver false hopes as opposed to having multiple clinical studies in real athletes to prove what it is they're claiming.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis is why Gaspari Nutrition chose highly branched cluster dextrin for what will become the gold standard of recovery and performance drinks, GLYCOFUSE. This high molecular weight carbohydrate has a special helical structure which gives it unique properties unlike many of the corn starches or polysaccharides out there. We'll be real with you and say this stuff isn't cheap, but you certainly pay for what you get. For an athlete like you who takes performance seriously we know you would expect nothing less from us except for REAL RESULTS, REAL FAST.\r\n\t\r\n\tGOLD MEDALLION CERTIFIED ELECTROLYTES FOR OPTIMAL NERVE TRANSMISSION AND MUSCLE PERFORMANCE\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen you sweat, your body loses potassium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, and calcium. They must be replaced to avoid cramping and losses in muscle performance because they are critical components in supporting nerve impulses and muscle contraction. Look at it this way, the more you sweat, the higher your potential need for increased hydration and electrolytes.\r\n\t\r\n\tYour need for extra electrolytes is based on how often, how long, and how hard you train. To give you an edge Gaspari Nutrition partnered up with Albion Labs where science and patented technology have been combined to create crucial electrolytes in a form the body can readily assimilate. Glycofuse bears this seal and is the first Gold Medallion certified carbohydrate powder on the market!\r\n\t Ingredients: Citric Acid, Malic Acid, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Beta Carotene (Color). *These statements have not been evaluated \r\n               by the Food and Drug Administration.

Dedicated to manufacturing high quality nutritional supplements backed by scientific research and formulated by a medical doc, Metabolic Nutrition was the first to introduce Trans-Alanyl-Glutamine Di-peptide to the marketplace.\r\n\tTAG Targeted Muscle Recovery\r\n\tAcclaimed by physicians, athletes and consumers alike, T.A.G. from Metabolic Nutrition, has the distinction of being the only \"Muscle Targeted Glutamine\" supplement in the market today. Due to its unique \"di-peptide\" designed chemical structure, T.A.G. is strong enough to be mixed in water or other beverages without any degradation which affects other glutamine products.\r\n\tUnlike Free-form L-Glutamine (which is mostly utilized in the intestines leaving as little as 10% for muscle tissue)…T.A.G. is far more superior as it is 100% assimilated into the bloodstream, directly transported and infused deep into muscle tissue. Engineered for muscle repair, T.A.G. prevents the loss of muscular glutamine during exercise, preventing \"protein catabolism\" (i.e. muscle loss)…therefore aiding in the maintenance and building of muscle intra and post workout. In addition to increasing recovery during and following exercise, T.A.G. also provides a complete recovery solution supporting the body's immune system, preventing muscle catabolism, and increasing protein synthesis and growth hormone release, making it a critical supplement in any athlete's regiment.\r\n\tSuggested Use on Training Days: As a dietary supplement, take 1 scoop with 6-10 oz of cold water, juice or protein shake, before and after workouts. Suggested Use on Non-Training Days: As a dietary supplement, take 1 scoop with 6-10 oz of cold water, juice or protein shake, once per day. Note: For added immune support, anti-oxidant benefits, and accelerated muscular repair and whole body recovery, add 1 serving of T.A.G. to any protein, meal replacement, pre/intra/post-workout supplement, or other Metabolic Nutrition products to further enhance desired results.\r\n\tDo not exceed recommended dose.

The study found that by increasing adrenaline levels, users were able to experience significantly more energy during their exercise, as well as push longer than normal. This is due to the body’s response to adrenaline which increases endurance and subjective strength, meaning that the person does not feel like they are exerting as much effort despite higher performance.\r\n\tCompete hard!\r\n\tWhen you’ve trained at your best for weeks and months on end, there is only one thing left to do… compete. Your competition may not be against anyone but yourself, but every once in a while each of us must test ourselves to make sure we are worthy of the term “warrior”. Not everyone is cut out to be the best, but that doesn’t mean each of us can’t compete at OUR best. We must test our strength, endurance, and raw explosive power to make sure we are as formidable of an opponent as possible. By rapidly enhancing key cellular processes within our body, Conquer™ is capable of forcing your body to experience the most progress you have ever imagined. Overpower your opponent with more strength than you’ve ever felt. Outlast your opponent by pushing through the now meaningless term “fatigue”. Overcome your opponent by powering through even the most challenging obstacles.\r\n\tCREATINE FOR PROFESSIONAL STRENGTH INCREASE:\r\n\tWhen it comes to clinically proven strength increasing ability, nothing compares to the raw power of Creatine Monohydrate. While countless studies can be cited to show just what Creatine Monohydrate is capable of, one stands out as the most pertinent to body composition and strength increased. This study[2] showed that after only 5 days of using Creatine Monohydrate, the men involved experienced an increase in their bodyweight and muscle mass, as well as incredible increases in their peak force production on the bench press.\r\n\tAGMATINE SULFATE FOR INSANE ENDURANCE ENHANCEMENT:\r\n\tOutlasting your opponents is absolutely crucial to being victorious. Our body’s rely on a constant supply of oxygen to help fuel our muscles, and allow us to keep moving. Unfortunately, after just a short time exercising, oxygen levels can plummet which in turn make us fatigue quicker than we’d like to. Conquer™ combats this by providing your body with more oxygen for your entire workout. It does this by significantly increasing your Nitric Oxide. Nitric Oxide works as a vasodilator (vein expander) which in turn allows our veins to transport more energy giving oxygen to our hungry muscles.\r\n\tgmatine Sulfate works through a dual process in which it not only increases Nitric Oxide, but it also inhibits our Nitric Oxide Synthase Enzyme, which systematically seeks out Nitric Oxide and removes it from our body. This makes Agmatine Sulfate the ultimate Nitric Oxide booster ever available!\r\n\tWhen Agmatine Sulfate dilates our veins, we not only get the benefit of enhanced endurance, but we also get an incredible pump. The pump is when our veins swell up and fill our muscles with more nutrients, oxygen, and blood than they’ve ever felt before. This “full and hard” sensation of our muscles is one of the most sought after feelings in the gym.\r\n\tPHENYLETHYLAMINE, N-METHYL-B-METHYLPHENYLETHYLAMINE, R-BETA-METHYLPHENYLETHYLAMINE FOR INSANE MIND MUSCLE CONNECTION!\r\n\tOne of the most overlooked secrets to performing at our best is enhancing what is known as the “mind muscle connection”. This term refers to how “in the zone” we are, and as a result how well our muscles respond to the signals given to them by our brain. Anyone who has exercised before know that on certain days they just “aren’t feeling it”, and find that no matter how hard they try, their body just won’t perform the way they’re expecting it to. These days are over.\r\n\tIncreasing your mind muscle connection is as simple as getting your brain to “talk” to your muscles more effectively. This can be accomplished with a class of compounds known as Phenethylamines. These chemicals act as neuromodulators and neurotransmitters in our brains which in turn provide us with a significantly enhanced pathway for our brain to “talk” to our muscles, and give them the proper instructions.\r\n\tWhen Phenethylamines increase the amount of energy in our brains, we experience something that is referred to “time dilation”. Time dilation is the perceived slowing of time, due to the increased speed of an object. When our brains work faster than normal, they are able to intake sensory information much quicker than usual, and as a result time around us tends to appear slower. This amazing phenomenon is what helps us get a huge leg up on the competition. Imagine how much easier it is to hit a baseball when a 90mph pitch feels like a 60mph pitch? Perhaps a better comparison for most weight lifters would be to think about how much easier it would be to perform a challenging lift if they had what seemed like more time to focus on each and every muscle contraction as it happened? Increasing your mind muscle connection will lead you to become a better athlete in very little time.\r\n\tConquer the competition!\r\n\tIf you’re ready to finally turn the tide, and WIN YOUR WAR, you have only one choice… to Conquer™ your combatants. While others may be training hard, you must train harder. When others bring their best to a competition, you have to bring more than you’ve ever thought possible. When you’ve trained harder and with more intensity than your opponents, you are ready to do the inevitable… Conquer™ anyone who stands in your way.\r\n\tDirections For Conquer: As a dietary supplement, consume 1-2 scoops approximately 20-45 minutes prior to exercise.

Well, whatever the case, Stimulant X will help you power through for a successful and productive day.\r\n\t\tHave you ever drank coffee or an energy drink and felt wide awake, but your brain is still too tired to think? Your brain is the most important productivity tool you possess, and your mood affects your mind’s ability to function efficiently and effectively. 1-MeTIQ™ is the powerful mood stimulator found in Stimulant X that elevates your mood for up to eight “feel good” hours.\r\n\t\tYou should feel Stimulant X start working in half an hour.

      "text": "What benefit does Platinum Pre have for my performance?\r\n\t\tThe benefits that Platinum Pre provides to your workout are based on the unique blend of scientifically proven ingredients it contains to include: Caffeine, Beta-Alanine, L-arginine, Capsicum Extract and Leucine.\r\n\t\tCaffeine is one of the most researched nutritional ingredients and Platinum Pre provides 160mg of caffeine per serving. Caffeine is able to target your muscles and brain to help get you through those tough workouts. Typically the benefits of caffeine are observed when it is consumed in one single dose 30-60 minutes before exercise. However the benefits to performance are mostly observed when doses around 1-2 mg / kg of body weight are consumed. In other words, an 80 kg athlete needs a caffeine dose of 80-160 mg before exercise. This is why Platinum Pre is highly effective at supporting your performance goals as it delivers a high caffeine dose before exercise.\r\n\t\tBeta-Alanine iis also found in Platinum Pre. During short duration, high intensity exercise your muscles produce a large amount of lactic acid which is known to alter the acidity of your muscle which is responsible for developing fatigue. Beta-alanine helps produce carnosine found in the skeletal muscle which is responsible for buffering the effects of lactic acid during exercise. Thanks to the delivery of 1.6 g of beta-alanine before exercise, Platinum Pre is therefore ideal for those of you who exercise regularly at a high intensity and want to make every workout count.\r\n\t\tWHAT YOU GET WITH 2 SCOOPS OF OPTIMUM PRE\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t4 GRAMS OF MICRONIZED CITRULLINE & PEPFORM CITRULLINE PEPTIDES\r\n\t\tL-citrulline is a precursor to Nitric Oxide (N.O.) synthesis and may support performance during high-intensity exercise. Each 4-gram dose in PLATINUM PRE- combines micronized L-citrulline with an exclusive patent-pending peptide delivery system.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t3.2 GRAMS OF CARNOSYN BETA-ALANINE\r\n\t\tBeta-alanine is a key building block for carnosine – a compound that helps neutralize acidic byproducts generated during high-intensity training. Research shows that daily supplementation increases muscle carnosine levels, supporting harder and longer training sessions.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t400 MG CAFFEINE\r\n\t\tAs the subject of numerous studies, caffeine is one of the most well-researched performance enhancing compounds. Along with increased energy and alertness, caffeine has been shown to help sharpen mental focus and reduce the perception of physical effort during exercise.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t250 MG CAPSICUM FRUIT EXTRACT\r\n\t\tCapsicum from chili peppers provides metabolic support. The capsicum dose in PLATINUM PRE- has been encapsulated so it doesn't interfere with the refreshing fruit flavor.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t500 MG PHYTOBLEND + 200 MG VITAMIN C\r\n\t\tA blend of Beat Juice Powder, Grape Seed Extract and Citrus Bioflavonoids with a potent dose of vitamin C provides antioxidant support to round out this comprehensive pre-workout formula.\r\n\t\tWhen is the best time to enjoy my drink?\r\n\t\tPlatinum Pre is perfect for those who want to get the most out of each and every workout. Mix up with water in your ON Shaker approximately 30-60 minutes before exercise. It is ideal for use early in the morning when it may be difficult to have a productive workout, but can also be used later in the day, especially for those tough workouts. However due to the caffeine content in Platinum Pre, it’s recommended not to consume the product too close to bed to avoid disturbing sleep quality.\r\n\tTake 1-2 scoops 20-40 minutes before training, or anytime you want a boost of energy and alertness. Mix each scoop with 6-10 oz (177-295mL) of cold water (to desired sweetness) and consume immediately. Start with 1 scoop or less to assess your tolerance. DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 2 SERVINGS PER DAY.\r\n\tNot for use by those with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking any medications, those under the age of 18 or over 50, women that are pregnant, contemplating pregnancy or nursing, or those that are caffeine or beta-alanine sensitive. Do not consume caffeine/stimulants from other sources or within 4 hours of bedtime. Keep Out Of Reach Of Children. Store in a cool, dry place.

      "text": "Hydrowhey-Fast acting Protein\r\n\tWhey is a very fast acting protein as it is, however, Optimum Nutrition wanted to make it even more readily available to your body, making it even fast acting than before! They have achieved this by hydrolyzing whey protein, making their fastest absorbing protein to date.\r\n\tPredigesting the protein, breaking it down in to smaller chunks, to make it more bioavailable, is how this is done. They haven’t stopped there! Hydro Whey also has added BCAAs and digestive enzymes, making this product even more effecting for repairing and building lean muscle.\r\n\tWhat Does It Do?\r\n\tPlatinum Hydrowhey contains a single-source protein composed entirely of hydrolysed whey protein isolates. Isolates are the purest form of whey protein with no excess fat, cholesterol, or lactose. Hydrolysing the isolates breaks the larger proteins down into smaller pieces.\r\n\tEach shake delivers 30g of pure whey protein, 8.8g of muscle building BCAAs, but with just 140 calories per serving.\r\n\tWhen Is The Best Time To Enjoy My Shake?\r\n\tPlatinum Hydrowhey is best enjoyed first thing in the morning, before or just after training. Platinum Hydrowhey mixes easily and tastes great. Simply mix one rounded scoop with your favourite beverage and drink in your ON shaker.\r\n\tPlatinum Hydrowhey is INSTANTIZED, so it always mixes up easily and completely. Simply add 1 rounded scoop of Platinum Hydrowhey to a blender, shaker cup, or glass filled with 12 ounces of cold water, milk, or juice and blend, shake, or stir for 20-30 seconds or until powder is dissolved. TIP: Adjust the intensity of your Platinum Hydrowhey shake by varying the amount of liquid you use to prepare it. For a slightly thicker consistency with a bolder flavor, mix each scoop with 10 ounces of water. For a milder tasting less sweet shake, use 14-16 ounces of liquid per scoop. Stack Your Shake: By adding dietary supplements including creatine, BCAA, and carbohydrate powders you can make Platinum Hydrowhey an even more powerful recovery product. TIP: Use faster acting Platinum Hydrowhey during the day and more slowly digested Gold Standard 100% Casein at night for around-the-clock amino acid coverage. Suggested Use: Consume approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day through a combination of high protein foods and protein supplements.

Yohimbine antagonizes, or “blocks”, alpha 2-receptors. This promotes greater lipolysis, or breakdown, of body fat. Supplementation with yohimbine has been reported to\r\n\tproduce weight loss in patients following a low-calorie diet.\r\n\t- Acetyl-L-Carnitine: Anecdotally, users of this well-studied form of carnitine report mood, energy and libido-enhancing benefits. Carnitine is perhaps best known for its role in the burning of fat.\r\n\t- L-Theanine: This naturally-occurring amino acid has anxiety-reducing and attention-enhancing properties.\r\n\t- Guarana EXT: Guarana has been shown to improve mood.\r\n\t- Hoodia gordonii EXT: This plant contains compounds believed to increase fullness, thereby making it easier to avoid  overeating. Overeating is the number-one barrier to getting lean.\r\n\t- CortiRX: This proprietary blend contains ingredients used to help support healthy cortisol levels. Cortisol levels tend to increase with stress and low-calorie dieting.\r\n\t- Rhodiola rosea EXT (4% Rosavins, 1% Salidroside): This adaptogenic herb has anxiety- and depression-reducing properties.\r\n\t-Magnolia Bark EXT: Standardized for 50% honokiol, a compound with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilating and muscle-relaxing properties.\r\n\t- Evodiamine 98%: Evodiamine comes from the plant Evodia rutaecarpae. In animal studies it has been found to stimulate thermogenesis and reduce weight gain. It also directly inhibits the formation of new fat cells.\r\n\t- Piperine EXT for enhanced absorption\r\n\t- User’s Choice: JETFUEL users say this is the thermogenic they come back to time and time again. In its fifth year of production, sales continue to grow!\r\n\t- Energy “Right Away”: One user reports, “The serving size is 3 capsules, but all I need is one or two and I have energy right away, all day, with no crash, no jitters.”\r\n\tTake 1-2 caps before doing cardio with plenty of water. Take 1-2 caps during the day for a quick energy boost. Take 1-2 caps with breakfast of before going to work. Take 1-2 caps before an exam, game, or other event requiring focus.

First came whey. Then whey isolates. Now you have isolate Fractions! Fractions are tiny segments of isolates (1 part in 2,000). The Actinos fraction of Pro-NOS increases nitric oxide. The VAT-Burn fraction burns off fat. And they both supply you the aminos to build muscle faster than ever before! Build More Muscle -\r\n\tFaster Your muscle growth depends on two factors: 1) how many aminos you can deliver to your muscle cell and, 2) how long you can keep the process of constructing new muscle (protein syntheses) cranking. With Pro-NOS, you do both - at the same time!\r\n\tYou see the whey fractions you find in Pro-NOS not only provide your body with the best muscle-building amino acids you can find, but they also increase nitric oxide giving you greater - and more sustained - amino delivery. That’s why with Pro-NOS you build more muscle - faster!\r\n\tIncrease Nitric Oxide Now you can boost your nitric oxide levels - without taking extra arginine! That’s with whey and only whey. You see, the Actinos fraction of Pro-NOS increases NOS enzymes that make nitric oxide out of arginine!\r\n\tStrip Off Belly Fat Now you can get more muscle definition without changing your diet or exercise. How? The VAT-Burn fraction of Pro-NOS specifically targets hard-to-lose belly fat! What’s more Vat-BURN burns off total body fat.\r\n\tPro-Nos is the biggest breakthrough in protein supplementation in over 20 years. It gives you the power to gain muscle and burn off fat faster than ever before. Without added ingredients. Just protein.\r\n\tHere`s how: What Makes Pro-NOS Different?\r\n\tThe stunning new technology is known as peptide multi-fractionation. Unlike today`s whey proteins that use peptide chains in their ``randomly occurring`` length, MRI has isolated the specific ``interval`` (length) within the peptide chains that holds all the concentrated power to change your body composition! You get two powerful physique-altering chain-length specific peptides in new Pro-NOS: ACTINOS™ increases nitric oxide. VAT-Burn™ strips of belly fat.\r\n\tBuild Muscle and Burn Off Fat - At the Same Time - With Fractionated Whey! Chest. Arms. Abs. With Pro-NOS, you get it all. The patent-pending NO-generating whey peptide fraction (ACTINOS™) amplifies nitric oxide levels. Without arginine or ``added ingredients.`` Just fractionated whey protein. Your muscles feel bigger and thicker within days. At the same time, the whey peptide fraction that breaks down fat (VAT-Burn™) begins chiseling and sculpting your abs like never before.\r\n\tPro-NOS Is Ideal To Take With All NO-Generators! Pro-NOS is designed to work synergistically with all nitric oxide products. You see, NO generators provide your body with arginine - the building block of NO. Pro-NOS makes sure you haveve got enough NOS enzymes. But it`s the NOS enzymes that convert the arginine into nitric oxide. Finally, NOS is no-longer the rate-limiting factor in NO production! With Pro-NOS, you get 42 grams of the highest quality whey isolates and concentrate! And it tastes great! It Takes 2,000 lbs of Whey to Make 1 Pro-NOS Jug In a clinical trial, subjects taking VAT-Burn reduced fat, as opposed to the calorie restricted specific control group. The clinical study further demonstrated that subjects dropped overall body fat loss.\r\n\tYour body has an enzyme called “Nitric Oxide Synthase” (NOS). That enzyme converts the arginine you supplement - or ingest - into nitric oxide. The problem is, you have a limited number of NOS enzymes - restricting the amount of nitric oxide your body can produce. Now see how the “Actinos Fraction” of Pro-NOS increases NOS, giving you the potential for “unlimited” nitric oxide production. In fact, studies prove the Actinos Fraction amplifies nitric oxide. Unleashing the “Primal Force” Locked Inside of Whey Isolates! “We’ve cracked the elusive protein code!” says Ed Byrd, MRI’s innovative CEO. “We’ve identified, and ‘cleaved off,’ the tiny, body-altering peptide ‘fractions’ locked within whey isolates. These small fractions give you ability to rapidly build muscle, burn fat, and increase nitric oxide - with whey fractions only! We’ve discovered the first genuine bodybuilding protein! We call it Pro-NOS. Welcome the new era in protein supplementation!” The Power of “Fraction” Technology\r\n\tHow can the small fractions in Pro-NOS give you such huge results?\r\n\tSimple. You see, all whey isolates come in peptide “chains.” Ordinary whey isolates, like you find in today’s whey products, occur in long “random” chain lengths. They may help supply your body with aminos - but do little more. Now observe the Pro-NOS difference! The Pro•NOS Fraction Technology identifies, and “cleaves off,” the two tiny “specific” fractions that help you build bigger, thicker muscles fast - then go way, way beyond! The Actinos™ fraction of Pro-NOS is clinically proven to amplify nitric oxide synthase enzymes! The VAT-Burn fraction is clinically proven to burn fat! All this, with whey fractions only! “Finding these fractions was like finding small bits of gold in large rocks!” says Ed Byrd. The truth is, it takes 6,000 pounds of today’s ordinary whey to produce just one jug of Pro-NOS. That’s how powerful these tiny fractions are!” Pro-NOS: The Landmark Scientific Achievement - through World-wide Collaboration Here is something you should know - before you try Pro-NOS. Pro-NOS represents the largest world-wide scientific research collaboration on protein ever known. The research spanned 3 continents. It involved the science team from largest protein company in the world - Glanbia International. It relied on MRI’s team of skilled formulation experts - hired directly from the major pharmaceutical companies. And the landmark discovery, validated by clinical trials, marks the most significant breakthrough in protein ever. That’s the reason why you can try Pro-NOS with absolute confidence\r\n\tMix 1 serving (2 scoops) of Pro-NOS with 12 fl. oz. of cold water or skim milk, mix well. Consume immediately. Take 2 servings of Pro-NOS daily.

      "text": "DARK MATTER\r\n\tSports nutrition experts and bodybuilders have long known that the most critical time to stimulate muscle growth through nutritional interfusion is post-workout. They refer to the 1-hour period immediately after training as the “Anabolic Window.” Over the years, supplements have been developed in an attempt to optimize this short muscle building opportunity. While some innovations and developments have been made, researchers concluded that still, no product on the market was fully optimizing this “window of muscle growth opportunity”. The direct short explanation why is simple. None of these products work fast enough and none of them had the right micronutrient timing at the Anabolic Axis! Now, thought the development of DARK MATTER, bodybuilders are finally maximizing this muscle building opportunity and packing on pounds of new muscle. Victor Martinez credits DARK MATTER for adding pounds of extra muscle to his already monstrous frame and being the difference in developing his championship physique.\r\n\tDon't waste another workout! If you want to start gaining serious size, chug down some DARK MATTER and introduce your muscles to a new frontier of hyper-anabolic muscle growth. The greatest opportunity to stimulate muscle growth is immediately after your workout. The faster you can get critical nutrients into your bloodstream and muscles, the better. DARK MATTER employs new technologies and compounds that allow for super-fast nutrient uptake and help spark a synergistic anabolic reaction during which insulin levels peak with amino acid, creatine and glycogen transport at the \"Anabolic Axis\" to trigger enhanced muscle growth and speed recovery. Immediately after your next training session, chug down some Dark Matter and introduce your muscles to a new frontier of growth as you enter the Anabolic Axis. Every Workout Ends with Dark Matter!\r\n\tAdd 1scoop to 8 fl. oz. of water in a glass or shaker bottle immediately after training. (For maximum results, you may take 2 scoops with 16 fl. oz. of water.) Stir or shake vigorously before drinking.\r\n\tContains wheat.\r\n\t "

      "url": "#",
      "text": "KEY BENEFITS OF ERGOBOLIC\r\n\tFor prolonged gains in strength and lean mass, you need to ensure that your body's hormones are in a positive anabolic state. Ergobolic  may help to minimize catabolic (muscle destroying) hormones like cortisol & myostatin, and promote the anabolic ones.\r\n\t\r\n\tImagine creating a list of every anabolic hormone versus a list of every catabolic hormone, and simply picking which ones you'd like to support and which ones you'd like less of? Well that's exactly what ErgoGenix did when creating   ErgoBolic ! They made both lists and designed a supplement that could protect our muscles from catabolic hormones, and also promote the anabolic process.\r\n\t\r\n\tYou may have heard of the so-called 'stress hormone' cortisol. It can not only break down your hard-earned muscle fibers, but can also lower two of your most anabolic hormones: testosterone and Insulin-like Growth Factor 1. Even worse, cortisol can lower the production of active thyroid hormone and actually help your body gain fat! Your cortisol levels may be elevated by any kind of stressful situation, from sitting in traffic to intense weight training.\r\n\t\r\n\tErgoBolic  could be the first sports nutrition product to include Sutherlandia frutescens, an herb that may help support healthy cortisol levels already in normal range. It not only helps to regulate that awful catabolic hormone; it may also help reduce the stress-induced rise in Myostatin - a hormone that can put the breaks on muscle growth.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs if that weren’t enough, Sutherlandia might also support the natural anabolic signals produced by the body. You don't need to know what PI3K, p-AKT, or MyoD are, or what the AKT/mTOR pathway is, but if you do, you know that they're powerful signaling proteins that tell your body to build more muscle. When you put mild stress on your body, whether it's from training or just from life, Sutherlandia may help support these signals to promote protein production! When the body experiences stress, Sutherlandia may actually help the body stop burning muscle for fuel and use fat instead.\r\n\t\r\n\tAnother ingredient in   ErgoBolic  is a well-known cortisol supporting supplement: Black Tea Extract (BTE). Black Tea Extract may promote the lowering of cortisol levels by up to 47%. Just imagine how much muscle and strength you could gain if you had 47% less cortisol in your body! \r\n\tFinally, they’ve added a very well known, ingredient: Momordica charantia. Momordica may help in promoting healthy blood sugar levels already in normal range and may help burn fat. And that’s not all! This herb is also a powerful inhibitor of the 11b-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme (11b-HSD1). You don't need to know what that means. The important part is the fact that this enzyme may activate cortisol. That could open the door to more size and strength - especially when working in combination with Sutherlandia and Black Tea Extract.\r\n\t\r\n\tIf you're serious about getting bigger and stronger,   ErgoBolic  is for you! \r\n\tAs a dietary supplement, take 2 capsules, twice daily. 2 in the Morning/Wake Up and 2 in the Evening before Bedtime.\r\n\tBefore using this product consult with your physician if you are using any prescription or over the counter medicine. Do not use if you have any pre-existing medical condition including but not limited to: high or low blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, heart, liver, kidney or thyroid disease, seizure disorder, psychiatric disease, diabetes, difficulty urinating due to prostate enlargement or if you are taking a MAO-B inhibitor or any other medication.

      "text": "C4 Extreme - NO3 Technology Creatine Nitrate\r\n\t \r\n\tC4 Extreme is powdered energy. Harnessing unparalleled NO3 technology and exclusive, premium ingredients such as Creatine Nitrate, C4 Extreme is an advanced pre-workout supplement, possessing the power to ignite your mind, muscles, and workout regimen, workout after workout after workout.\r\n\tNO3 is Nitrate, an advanced compound that delivers unbelievable muscle pumps and amplifies the effectiveness of every ingredient in C4 Extreme. Cellucor is utilizing a new compound where NO3 has been fused to Creatine to create Creatine Nitrate; according to a UCLA study, Creatine Nitrate is 1000x more water soluble than either Creatine Monohydrate or other creatine derivatives. Unmatched water solubility ensures better absorption and absolutely none of the traditional side effects of Creatine supplementation.\r\n\t\r\n\tYou will have more energy than you ever imagined possible from a supplement. You will get that extra rep and complete that last set, detonating any previous strength, endurance, and physique personal bests.\r\n\tC4 EXTREME Ingredients Highlight:\r\n\tMagnesium Creatine Chelate\r\n\tCreatine Magnapower is a highly advanced form of creatine that delivers instantaneous strength and recovery gains without the side effects of Creatine Monohydrate such as water retention or bloating. Magnesium Creatine Chelate is a buffered solution containing creatine and magnesium. Because buffered solutions are pH-resistant, the creatine is able to bypass breakdown in the stomach, resulting in greater absorption and no stomach discomfort. Magnesium is also augments energy and ATP levels within the muscles.\r\n\tBeta Alanine\r\n\tBeta Alanine is a naturally occurring amino acid. Beta Alanine produces higher intramuscular carnosine levels which amplifies energy levels, supports muscular endurance, and improves performance. Beta Alanine is an effective fatigue arrester— it acts as a buffer, preventing lactic acid accumulation in skeletal muscle (which occurs during exercise) allowing the body to perform better, longer.\r\n\tArginine AKG\r\n\tArginine AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate) is a potent precursor to nitric oxide. AKG increases vascularity and strength and promotes growth hormone and insulin secretion. It is an effective vasodilator, enlarging the blood pathways into the muscles, resulting in improved blood flow, muscle pumps, and more efficient nutrient delivery.\r\n\tN-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine\r\n\tN-Acetyl-L-tyrosine is a more rapidly absorbed and bio-available form of L-Tyrosine that is less prone to urinary excretion. L-Tyrosine is an amino acid precursor to the adrenal and growth hormones epinephrine, dopamine and norepinephrine. These hormones support HGH release, and contribute to higher energy levels, awareness, and mental alertness.\r\n\tVitamin B12\r\n\tMethylcobalamin is a potent form of Vitamin B12, an essential B-vitamin. Vitamin B12 greatly supports cellular metabolism and energy production and aids in the production of fatty acids—broken down fats that are then easily burned. Vitamin B12 also promotes healthy nervous system function and blood formation.\r\n\tCAFFEINE\r\n\tCaffeine is a powerful psychoactive stimulant.* Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, warding off fatigue and promotes increased alertness and energy levels.\r\n\tNIACINAMIDE\r\n\tNiacinamide is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, also known as Vitamin B-3, e improves joint mobility, muscle strength, and nervous system function. Niacinamide decreases muscular fatigue and increases maximal muscle working capacity.\r\n\tFOLIC ACID\r\n\tFolic acid is a water-soluble B-vitamin that promotes positive mood and higher energy levels.* Folic acid also supports healthy cell formation and repair.\r\n\tSYNEPHRINE HCL\r\n\tSynephrine is a potent adrenergic stimulator that augments energy levels and ATP synthesis. Synephrine, although milder, is structurally similar to Ephedra. The compound enhances adrenaline stimulation and promotes weight loss by amplifying fat burning, metabolism, and thermogenesis.\r\n\tFrequently Asked Questions:\r\n\tHow Do I take C4 Extreme?\r\n\tTo take C4 Extreme, simply mix 1-2 scoops with water (or juice) 15-30 minutes prior to your workout. Begin by using just 1 Scoop to assess tolerance.\r\n\tShould I take C4 Extreme with food?\r\n\tC4 Extreme may be taken with food or on an empty stomach.\r\n\tCan I take C4 Extreme with other Cellucor products?\r\n\tC4 can be taken with P6 Extreme for an explosive muscle-growth stack. C4 Extreme and NZero can be mixed for an ultra-lean, high-energy preworkout. C4 can be stacked with any of Cellucor’s non-stimulant weight loss options once personal caffeine tolerance levels are assessed.\r\n\tI am currently on prescription medication, can I take C4 Extreme?\r\n\tIf you are currently taken a prescribed medication and/or suffer from a previously-diagnosed medical condition, we request that you consult your physician prior to using any Cellucor product. Product labels and supplement facts are available on our website for your physician’s review.\r\n\tI am a drug-tested athlete, can I take C4 Extreme?\r\n\tAlthough none of our products contain illegal substances, the answer to this question depends on what the specific athletic governing body is testing for.

We advise that athletes consult with their respective governing bodies to ensure their supplement regimen is within guidelines and obtain clearance prior to using any Cellucor product.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n\t\r\n\tSUGGESTED USE:\r\n\t\r\n\tDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DAILY INTAKE. USE ONLY AS DIRECTED. Directed Use On Training Days: To determine tolerance, begin by taking one serving (1 scoop) mixed with (4 - 6 oz.) of water 20 - 30 minutes before training.

Its antioxidant blend also provides key nutrients like Lutein, Lycopene and Grape Seed Extract to further support your body's daily defenses against damaging free radicals. This multi-vitamin was formulated based on solid science and designed to deliver all of its wholesome nutrition in just 1 easy-to-swallow veggie capsule.\r\n\tOmegafort SCC: Supercritical Concentration (SCC) Fish Oil\r\n\tOmega-3s are essential fatty acids most commonly found in fish that you must consume through your diet. Omegafort is a Supercritical Concentration (SCC) fish oil. It is 4x more concentrated than the standard 30% Omega-3 fish oil. Just one Omegafort™ (SCC) softgel provides 1,200mg of Omega 3 and is equivalent to 4 standard fish oil softgels/caps.\r\n\tRichBerry: The Power of Berries and Vegetables in Just One Capsule\r\n\tThe USDA recommends 3-5 servings of fruit and 2 to 4 servings of vegetables every day. Most people do not meet their daily servings of fruits and vegetables. To make matters worse, the processing of fruits and vegetables today may diminish nutrient levels. The USDA also recommends you consume 3,000 to 5,000 units of ORAC daily from fruits and vegetables. ORAC stands for Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity; a guideline for the antioxidant capacity of foods. The RichBerry™ included in WOD-Pak provides 3,000 ORAC units.\r\n\tVitamin D: High Dose of an Essential Fat Soluble Vitamin for Athletes\r\n\tVitamin D has recently become one of the hottest vitamins in the health and fitness community as a result of its numerous benefits for sedentary and active individuals. It has been shown to support proper calcium balance, support your immune system and promote healthy blood pressure.\r\n\tMinerals + Vitamin K2: High Absorption Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc\r\n\tCalcium, Magnesium and Zinc are vital minerals in the diet of any athlete or recreational lifter. Calcium supports bone health as well as nerve and muscle function. Magnesium is involved in energy metabolism and supports normal muscle and nerve function as well as a healthy immune system. Magnesium is also linked to bone health. Zinc is heavily involved in cellular metabolism as well as enzyme activity in the body, ranging from supporting immune system function to protein synthesis.\r\n\tWhen it comes to supplementation of these vital minerals, the source is just as important as the total amount since different forms of the minerals have different absorption rates. WOD-Pak provides multiple sources for these minerals to promote adequate absorption. Vitamin K2, although not common in many multi-vitamin supplements, may promote proper calcium utilization in the body. Its reported activity supports blood vessel and heart health as well.

      "text": "Beef has proven itself as a favourite anabolic protein source for many champion bodybuilders. MuscleMeds advanced hydrolyzed Beef Protein Isolate is capable of delivering rapid absorption of high concentrations of amino acids fast. Carnivor Mass provides the mass building benefits of beef “at the speed of whey,” without the lactose, allergies, fat, cholesterol and other problems associated with dairy products. MuscleMeds BPI is 350% more concentrated in amino acids than steak and more concentrated than whey. And it’s enhanced with 5 grams of creatine and additional BCAAs for even greater anabolic power!\r\n\t \r\n\tInsulin Release Amplification\r\n\tThe speed at which a nutrient particle is absorbed is partly a function of its surface area. The greater the surface area the more digestive enzyme molecules can react with it simultaneously. This promotes greater rates of absorption and amplified insulin release. The MuscleMeds lab managed to reduce the average size of the carbohydrates particles in iSpike while increasing the total number of particles. The result is a staggering increase in reactive surface area and faster absorption. This could result in the feeling of anabolism you’ve been waiting for!\r\n\t \r\n\tDid you know that when you drink calories rather than chew them, you skip the important first step of carbohydrate digestion and bypass carbohydrate digesting enzymes secreted into your saliva? This fact has been totally neglected by makers of conventional mass gainers. It can result in a delay in caloric absorption. iSpike addresses this problem with a natural system of amylases that slices through every carbohydrate particle in its path. iSpike enzymes act on straight chains of glucose molecules as well as at branch points. This encourages insulin release amplification that wouldn’t be possible with regular foods or garden-variety mass gainers.\r\n\t \r\n\tHigh-speed BPI, surface area enhanced carbohydrates and a multi-action enzyme system – you’d think this combination would be enough to create some major mass gains. But MuscleMeds went a step further by giving iSpike a novel amino acid for increased mass building effects. Now every serving of Carnivor Mass has the potential to deliver that much more of an anabolic impact.\r\n\t \r\n\tOnce insulin is released into the bloodstream, it has to find its way into muscle tissue where it can transmit anabolic signals. If you’ve never heard of adiponectin, you’re not alone. Scientists believe that adiponectin may function as a gatekeeper, allowing more insulin to reach your muscles upon entering the bloodstream. This is critical if you want the calories you eat to be used to build muscle mass and not be stored as fat. The botanical extract ingredient in Carnivor Mass was shown to have a positive effect on adiponectin levels which may result in greater muscle gain.\r\n\t \r\n\tProviding iSpike with its second and third layers of insulin signal amplifying support is a patent-pending mineral known as Chromium 454 (Cr454) and D-pinitol (a cyclitol). These two compounds take over where insulin leaves off, opening up even more “doors” on the surface of your muscle cells through which glucose can penetrate. In vitro study results show that Cr454 increases glucose uptake into human skeletal muscle cells by an impressive 300%. With more glucose entering your muscle cells in the presence of insulin, even stronger anabolic signals are possible, which support faster speeds of glycogen replenishment and mass building.\r\n\tCarnivor Mass Hightlights:\r\n\tBest Time to Use:\r\n\tWith its Beef Protein Isolate and iSpike Technology, CARNIVOR MASS allows the advanced bodybuilder to achieve high-speed macronutrient delivery and support near-perfect insulin management in one convenient product. Because its insulin-spiking actions are acute (lasting 30 minutes to 2 hours), CARNIVOR MASS is ideal for consumption:\r\n\tWhat to Expect:\r\n\tIn a pre-market consumer test conducted by MuscleMeds R&D team, bodybuilders using CARNIVOR MASS experienced benefits including but not limited to:\r\n\tAdd 16 fl. oz. of water to a shaker bottle, blender or other container. Add 4 scoops of Carnivor Mass. Mix or blend until the desired texture is achieved before drinking. For a thicker, sweeter shake, add less water. For a thinner shake, add more water.\r\n\tKeep out of reach of children. Protect from heat, light and moisture.

      "text": " \r\n\tBENEFITS OF SHOTGUN 5X\r\n\tSupports Increased Muscle DNA & Muscle Gene Proteins to Support Muscle Growth*\r\n\tWHAT IS SHOTGUN 5X\r\n\tSHOTGUN 5X is the first VPX® muscle building supplement to use a superior synergistic blend of effective compounds combined with a cutting-edge delivery system that promotes mind blowing, skin bursting effects, while additionally supporting recovery and protein synthesis.* Compounds such as Creatine, Beta-Alanine, and Branch Chain Amino Acids are each combined with Ethyl Ester technology to promote maximum absorption and uptake!* The Ethyl Ester Compounds used in SHOTGUN 5X help these potent muscle building ingredients enter the bloodstream nearly 100% intact, as opposed to the same ingredients without Ethyl Ester technology that might only be absorbed at 15% to 40%.* This highly advanced Ethyl Ester technology shuttles these SHOTGUN 5X compounds across the muscle cell membrane where they can help promote muscle growth!* VPX highly recommends stacking pre-workout SHOTGUN 5X with post-workout SYNTHESIZE.\r\n\tTHE SCIENCE\r\n\tSHOTGUN 5X is suggested to support Total Muscle DNA and Promote Five Muscle Gene Proteins.\r\n\tMuscle DNA is important because DNA carries the genetic information of a cell. DNA encodes the information for muscle proteins and is able self-replicate. Because SHOTGUN 5X supports muscle DNA, there's some crazy off-the-chain activity going on inside the muscle cell.* Imagine, you can have a limited amount of naturally occurring muscle DNA replication going on with resistance training and get your usual lackluster results in muscle growth. Or, you can consume SHOTGUN 5X and experience muscle generated by a mind-blowing 148.65% increase in muscle DNA.* Consequently, if weight training produced a 40% increase in DNA and this muscle DNA self-replicated at a rate of 10 fold, you would get a 400% increase in Muscle DNA and over the period of a year might be lucky to gain 7 pounds of lean muscle - hypothetically speaking. However, if the same DNA self-replication rate held true at 10 fold drinking SHOTGUN 5X, an even greater increase in muscle gene proteins could occur. One can only guess how much growth is possible at this rate in a year's time. While some of this is theoretical science, the fact holds true that muscle gene proteins may increase at a great rate with use of one container of SHOTGUN 5X over a four week period.* Therefore, drinking SHOTGUN 5X prior to training supports muscle building.*\r\n\tDNA is your cell's 'blueprint' for everything that goes on in your body. Your DNA is housed in the nucleus of each of your cells, and muscle cells have more than one nucleus. Think of the nucleus of your cell as the 'brains' behind the cell. It ultimately determines what your cell makes (i.e. proteins). So an increase in your muscle's DNA is an indication that the nuclei have a greater capacity for increasing muscle protein. Also, with more nuclei (and DNA), your muscle cells have greater control over what goes on in muscle. For bodybuilders, that means you become better at attaining bigger and greater numbers of muscle fibers. And the scientific suggestion is in the University Research. Consequently, this is why SHOTGUN 5X may support massive gains in strength, size, and muscle proteins.*\r\n\tThe chart above shows that drinking a serving of SHOTGUN 5X pre-workout for one month may increase Muscle DNA over three times more than training alone (with a placebo)*. That's huge! And, that may translate in to increases in lean muscle mass.* In fact, as you read the charts throughout this page, you will see that this increase in new muscle is crisp, sharp water-free lean muscle mass gains.* This is important because other companies may claim \"water retention\" as part of the gains in lean mass form their product. While it is true that these are not fat gains, it is highly untrue and unethical to count a water-retaining-bloat as muscle. This is why other companies include a significant amount of carbohydrates in their formulae - A) its cheap and, B) they deceptively claim that the water-weight gain from the carbohydrates is lean muscle. Each gram of carbohydrate makes you hold three grams of water. Drink their carb-laden product for a month and you'll be holding more water than a Whale, and these unscrupulous companies will tell you that your bloat is research-backed gains in lean muscle!*\r\n\tWhat if we told you that taking 21 grams per day of a pre-workout supplement would not only help put on muscle mass, but do it by elevating the Myogenic Regulatory Factors or MRFs? What are the MRFs you ask? In the broadest sense, MRFs are proteins that bind to DNA thus controlling how genetic information is passed from DNA to RNA. These MRFs thus control the creation of new muscle tissue. Now unless you decide to take a molecular biology class, take our word for it that these MRFs are highly important for regulating muscle mass. So, let's get to the meat of the matter. Where's the scientifically-backed university research? And, what does this mean to you as far as gaining more lean mass faster and more efficiently?\r\n\tSo how did the Increases in Muscle Gene Proteins, Muscle DNA and Myogenic Regulatory Factors translate into real world bodybuilding results with SHOTGUN 5X?\r\n\tResearchers at a prestigious university performed the complicated task of unraveling the secrets of SHOTGUN 5X. In science lingo, they sought out to determine the effects of four weeks of heavy resistance exercise combined with the oral ingestion of SHOTGUN 5X supplementation on body composition, muscle strength and mass, and markers of satellite cell activation.* If you paid attention in biology class, satellite cells are cells that sit on the periphery of muscle cells; when you damage or exercise your muscles it activates these cells; and that my friends, is a good thing. Why? Because satellite cells make existing muscle fibers BIGGER and in some extreme cases, may even contribute to making new muscle fibers . Imagine that. Larger muscle fibers as well as the potential to make mind-blowing gains in muscle fiber number too!\r\n\tThese scientists measured body composition (how much muscle and fat the subjects had), muscle strength, muscle mass, myofibrillar protein content and markers of satellite cell activation [serum IGF-1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-met tyrosine kinase (c-met)], proliferation (Myo-D, myf-5), and differentiation (myogenin, MRF-4, total DNA content).\r\n\tStudy volunteers consumed 21 grams/day of placebo [PL] or 21 grams/day of SHOTGUN 5X. For both the SHOTGUN 5X and placebo the dosage was ingested 30 minutes prior to each exercise session to take advantage of nutrient timing to maximize the benefits of SHOTGUN 5X.\r\n\tOn days where no exercise occurred, the full dosage of each supplement was ingested in the morning upon waking. Participants lifted weights 4-days per week split into two upper and two lower body workouts per week for a total of four weeks. The human test subjects performed a bi-weekly upper body resistance-training program consisting of nine exercises including bench press, lat pull down, shoulder press, seated rows, shoulder shrugs, chest flies, biceps curl, triceps press down, and abdominal curls twice per week. Test subjects also performed a bi-weekly lower-body program consisting of seven exercises including leg press or squat, back extension, step ups, leg curls, leg extension, calf raises, and abdominal crunches. Participants performed 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions with 75%-80% of their 1-RM (rep max) on each exercise. Rest periods between exercises and sets lasted no longer than three minutes.\r\n\tSo what were the results of the SHOTGUN 5X study?\r\n\tResearchers surmised that four weeks of SHOTGUN 5X supplementation used in conjunction with heavy resistance training effectively increased muscle strength and mass and promoted myogenesis by stimulating increases in markers indicative of satellite cell activation and proliferation.* In English, that means that SHOTGUN 5X may produce more lean muscle mass and it does so by activating your genetic machinery.* And for those of you worried about 'bloating' from a pre-workout supplement, SHOTGUN 5X didn't cause any water retention!* More importantly, gains in lean body mass were observed!*\r\n\tSHOTGUN 5X combined with heavy resistance training helped elevate myogenic regulatory factors [MHFs] by up to 71.17%.*\r\n\tSummary: This suggests that SHOTGUN 5X is our first supplement that turns on the MYOGENIC REGULATORY FACTORS!* For you science buffs out there MRFs are defined by the scientist like this: “A family of muscle-specific transcription factors which bind to DNA in control regions and thus, regulate myogenesis.* All members of this family contain a conserved helix-loop-helix motif which is homologous to the myc family proteins. These factors are only found in skeletal muscle. Members include the myoD protein (MYOD PROTEIN); MYOGENIN; myf-5, and myf-6 (also called MRF4 or herculin).”\r\n\tThe KEY word above is MYOGENESIS, which means the formation of muscle tissue.\r\n\tSummary: SHOTGUN 5X has safety data on 30 clinical markers† showing no side effects while promoting gains in lean muscle mass, strength, and measures of skeletal muscle anabolism.* This is the epitome of the anabolic drive. With SHOTGUN 5X, you'll have our very best tool to help you achieve the highest level of performance and bodybuilding goals.*\r\n\tNote: these clinical markers included all of the following: triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, GTT, LDH, uric acid, glucose, BUN, creatinine, BUN/creatinine, calcium, total protein, total bilirubin, ALP, AST, ALT, CK, WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils).\r\n\tSTACK WITH SYNTHESIZE®\r\n\tFor even better results, combine with SYNTHESIZE as your Post-Workout supplement.\r\n\tSYNTHESIZE is the Post-Workout Supplement of Choice!\r\n\tLet's face it, what you consume BEFORE and AFTER you train is the most critical issue with supplement use! That's why VPX's SHOTGUN 5X and SYNTHESIZE form the dynamic duo of lean mass enhancing supplements.* The beauty of this system, called nutrient timing, is that SHOTGUN 5X and SYNTHESIZE form the perfect bookends for delivering the precise ratio of muscle-building nutrients before and after you train.*\r\n\tWhat's the strategy for achieving gains in muscle mass fast and with ease? Nutrient timing is actually quite simple my friends. In fact, just do this, consume SHOTGUN 5X 30 minutes before you workout and SYNTHESIZE immediately after you workout. That strategy alone can help support lean muscle gains.* SYNTHESIZE is the culmination of scientific brilliance coupled with real-world results. SYNTHESIZE can be taken any time of day, even before bed, but it is ideal immediately post-training and/or during training. Here are just a few revolutionary anabolic-boosting and cell-volumizing ingredients that you'll find in SYNTHESIZE: Creatinol-O-Phosphate, or COP, which has been suggested to have cardioprotective effect by an action on anaerobic glycolysis.*¹ Creatine Phosphate Tetrahydrate promotes anaerobic working capacity.*² Also included in the formula is Beta-Alanine, for improving time to exhaustion, supporting increased whole body creatine retention and acting as a lactic acid buffer.*³ With a star-studded profile of other cutting-edge ingredients, VPX's SYNTHESIZE is the perfect complement to MRF-inducing SHOTGUN 5X!*\r\n\tReferences \r\n\t\r\n\tRecommended Use: \r\n\tDo not use SHOTGUN® 5X™ with REDLINE® or MELTDOWN® or any other products containing caffeine or other stimulants. Mix one scoop of SHOTGUN® 5X™ with 8 to 10 ounces of water or your favorite beverage. Drink SHOTGUN® 5X™ prior to any athletic event or resistance training. For enhanced results also consume FAST 5™ during and NO-SYNTHESIZE® after training. Unlike other Supplements which may require several scoops, SHOTGUN® 5X™ is extremely powerful and requires only one scoop. The SHOTGUN® 5X™, FAST 5™, and NO-SYNTHESIZE® supplement strategy represents the most advanced and latest muscle growth and athletic performance research."

      "text": "Superior Creatine\r\n\tC.G.P. is ideal for any consumer who demands superior quality, uncompromising results, and is looking to increase lean muscle mass, strength, endurance, and maximize physical enhancement.Dedicated to manufacturing high quality nutritional supplements backed by scientific research and formulated by a medical doctor. Metabolic Nutrition was the first to introduce Creatine-Glycerol-Phosphate to the marketplace. Acclaimed by physicians, athletes and consumers alike, C.G.P. has the distinction of delivering pure \"Muscle Torque Energy\" in a 100% stable and absorbable phosphate bonded creatine supplement. Unlike creatine monohydrate which mostly converts into \"Creatinine\" [a toxic and unusable form of creatine] once mixed in liquid, C.G.P's chemical structure is strong enough to be mixed in water or other beverages without any degradation which affects other creatine products. Engineered with a glycerol compound, C.G.P. is able to accelerate absorption in the GI Track via a specialized pathway, thus eliminating all negative side effects such as cramps, bloating and nausea associated with most creatine products. C.G.P's superior phosphate bonded chemical structure remains completely intact and is directly assimilated into your bloodstream.

Not only do the ingredients in C.G.P. prolong physical stamina, but they also improve nutrition utilization and muscle recovery making it a critical supplement in any athlete's workout. Creatine-Glycerol-Phosphate Complex: Potassium, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Magnesium, Calcium, Sodium.\r\n\tMuscle Torque Energy\r\n\tDedicated to manufacturing high quality nutritional supplements, backed by scientific research and formulated by a medical doctor, Metabolic Nutrition was the first to introduce Creatine-Glycerol-Phosphate to the marketplace. Acclaimed by physicians, athletes and consumers alike, C.G.P. has the distinction of delivering pure \"Muscle Torque Energy\" in a 100% stable and absorbable phosphate bonded creatine supplement. Unlike creatine monohydrate which mostly converts into \"Creatinine\" (a toxic and unusable form of creatine) once mixed in liquid, C.G.P.'s chemical structure is strong enough to be mixed in any beverage without any degradation or conversion to creatinine.\r\n\tDue to C.G.P.'s high absorption rate, a \"loading phase\" or \"high carbohydrate\" beverage is not needed, allowing C.G.P. to be used by individuals on low carbohydrate diets.

      "text": "Melatonin  is a hormone produced in the body and secreted at night. Taken as a dietary supplement, it is designed to help combat insomnia and may be useful for jet-lag. N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, or melatonin, is hormone produced naturally by the body in the pineal gland of the brain. The release of melatonin correlates with the body's cycle of day and night. The highest levels of the hormone are produced at night. Trace amounts of melatonin appears in foods.\r\n\t Melatonin  may play an essential role in sleeping and immune system deficiencies. As light inhibits its production, and darkness stimulates it, melatonin regulates the body's internal clock. Double blind research shows that this hormone helps people sleep, shortens the number of awakenings in the night, and improves the quality of sleep. It is also very useful in treating jet lag, as it promotes quicker recovery from that \"out of it\" stage one may experience after extended periods of flight. Research has also shown that having enough melatonin exhibits positive psychological benefits on a person's mood, while a lack of melatonin corresponds to anxiety, fatigue, and hostility. Melatonin has also been investigated for its anti-aging potential.\r\n\tSleep is crucial for Muscle Growth, you grow when you sleep.

Just super concentrated ingredients, at scientifically validated effective dosages to fuel your workouts with pure power….unstoppable energy… and crazy pumps. With just one ultra-concentrated scoop of PWR, your workouts will never be same again!\r\n\tWhat makes PWR different from other \"pre-workout\" supplements?\r\n\t\r\n\tPWR is three times more potent and costs nearly half the price than leading pre-workout brands. That's because PWR is ultra-concentrated and truly is the only \"one scoop\" pre-workout formula. There's no fluff. No bells and whistles. Just pure, unadulterated power. That means you get three times more \"workout servings\" at half the price! Do the math… That's big savings + more workouts = BIG VALUE!\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat's more, PWR contains two ingredients you won't find in any other pre-workout formulas. Nitrates to deliver more nitric oxide and promote harder, fuller pumps. And, maslinic acid to reduce inflammation and help your muscles exert more power, so you can train harder and longer, while enjoying super intense pumps.\r\n\tWhat results should I expect?\r\n\t\r\n\tWith a single, concentrated scoop of PWR, you can expect the most intense workouts ever… bigger, fuller, harder muscle pumps… laser-like mental focus… and pure, raw power. With your first PWR workout, you'll see why the research scientists at iSatori Technologies have set a new standard in concentrated pre-training supplementation and why over 250 \"beta-tester\" hardcore bodybuilders around the world trusted their physiques and strength gains to PWR and gave it five stars!\r\n\tWhat's in PWR, and how does it work?\r\n\t\r\n\tPWR has set the standard in ultra-concentrated pre-workout ingredients. So you can be assured you're getting the most effective dosages, backed by legitimate scientific studies. Click here to view the PWR ingredient profile and usage instructions.\r\n\tHow do I take PWR for optimal results?\r\n\t\r\n\tYou should always read the label thoroughly and follow the instructions.\r\n\t \r\n\tDIRECTIONS FOR THE MOST INTENSE WORKOUT:\r\n\t\r\n\tMix one serving (one level scoop) of PWR with 4-6 ounces of water, and drink 15-20 minutes before you workout, preferably on an empty stomach. Because PWR is so intense and potent, you may want to begin use with one-half the recommended serving for the first week to assess your tolerance.\r\n\t\r\n\tWARNING: CONSUMING MORE THAN ONE SCOOP, USER ASSUMES ALL RISKS AND LIABLITY.\r\n\tWhat makes PWR different from MORPH MegaDrive?\r\n\t\r\n\tBoth PWR and MORPH MegaDrive were designed to fuel your most powerful workouts ever. However, MORPH MegaDrive is the only pre-training formula that hits all 7 muscle/energetic pathways and is the only formula that contains EPO Blood Builder™ for unstoppable muscular stamina and Promino-Plex™ Whey Protein Hydrolysates to rebuild your muscles, faster... proven by a legitimate scientific study to produce muscular gains from your first workout and every time thereafter! In other words, MORPH MegaDrive has all the bells and whistles. It's the MOST COMPLETE pre-workout supplement on the market.\r\n\t\r\n\tPWR takes a more simplistic approach. It's been stripped of all the extras, leaving you with, quite simply, the best value \"bang\" for your hard-earned pre-workout \"buck.\" While it doesn't contain all of the bells and whistles that Morph MegaDrive does, what it does come with is scientifically validated dosages of the ingredients you need to provide pure power… unstoppable energy… and crazy pumps, with just one ultra-concentrated scoop. But don't let its concentrated formula fool you—the ingredients contained in PWR are controversial, to say the least, and designed to provide you with the most powerful workout you've ever had!\r\n\tWhat type of a training program should I follow when using PWR to really maximize the effects?\r\n\t\r\n\tTo maximize your workouts and build new, lean, hard muscle, we suggest you combine PWR with a workout program that is intense and designed so you work out at least five days a week, and take two days \"off,\" such as our popular Maximum Growth, Volume II, Plan. In addition, it's imperative to follow a nutrition plan that provides plenty of protein, whole-grain carbohydrates, and limits fat to no more than 20% of the daily food intake.\r\n\tAre there known side effects or health risks?\r\n\t\r\n\tThere are no known side effects with PWR. However, because it contains beta-alanine, a tingling or flushing sensation may be noticed within the first few minutes. This feeling is normal, harmless, and should subside within two to three weeks of continuous use. If this feeling is intolerable, though, we recommend lowering your dose or discontinuing use. And because this product contains caffeine, you should not consume it with other sources of caffeine like tea, coffee, stimulants, or energy beverages.Ingredients: Natural and artificial flavors, citric acid, calcium silicate, sucralose, acesulfame potassium. *These statements have not been evaluated \r\n               by the Food and Drug Administration.

Unlike anything you've ever seen before, because until today, this newly developed product category—called Bio-Active Peptides (or BAP's for short)—has never existed in sports nutrition. It's an entirely new category, for building muscle. iSatori has custom engineered and patented the first Bio-Active Peptides found only in Bio-Gro, yielding precise ratios of Proline-Rich Peptides (PRP's); Growth Factors (IgF, TGF beta-2, EGF, PDGF); Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA); Lactoferrin; and Fibroblast-GF. These custom BAP's are designed to provide a supra-physiological effect that, once consumed, signals the body to amplify its natural protein synthesis process, helping you develop lean muscle and recover faster from intense workouts, far more than you can on your own or no matter how much protein you consume. Basically, you can think of Bio-Gro as \"fertilizer for your muscles.\"\r\n\tBio Gro FAQ:\r\n\tWhat is Bio-Gro?\r\n\tBio-Gro is a true \"game-changer\" from iSatori. The first to introduce a new breed of designer supplementation called Bio-Active Peptides . You can think of Bio-Gro as \"fertilizer for your muscles.\"\r\n\tHow does Bio-Gro work?\r\n\tiSatori has custom engineered and patented the first and most technically advanced, low molecular weight, micro-concentrated form of Bio-Active Peptides (BAP's) found only in Bio-Gro. Designed to provide a supra-physiological effect that, once consumed, signals the body to amplify its natural protein synthesis process, helping you develop lean muscle and recover faster from intense workouts.\r\n\tWhat are Bio-Active Peptides? \r\n\tThe engineered Bio-Active Peptides (or BAP's) found only in Bio-Gro use a patented manufacturing method, whereby cleaved protein fragments are extracted from the highest grade bovine colostrums, which are then centrifugated and micro-concentrated to form a low molecular weight, highly bioavailable powder, yielding an exact concentration of bioactive:\r\n\tWho should use Bio-Gro?\r\n\tBio-Gro should be used by anyone who is interested in developing or maintaining more lean body mass and enhancing recovery from exercise or sport. This would include bodybuilders, fitness, figure, or physique competitors; and athletes competing in any sport, whether collegiate, professional, or recreational. Or, anyone who finds it difficult (or too costly) to consume higher amounts of protein in a day and would rather rely on a more concentrated form of the bio-actives the body will use to amplify protein synthesis.\r\n\tCan women use Bio-Gro?\r\n\tAbsolutely! Many athletic women already do. Because Bio-Gro contains almost zero calories, zero fat, and zero sugars, it is perfect for dieters or women who are calorie- or carb-conscience yet want the bioactive benefits of protein to help develop and maintain lean body tissue. And Bio-Gro requires only one tiny scoop (1.5 grams) compared to a large-sized protein shake (25 grams or more), that can leave your stomach feeling full of gas and bloated. What's more, Bio-Gro is derived from a natural source and is safe for anyone to consume.\r\n\tWhat can I expect from using it?\r\n\tBio-Gro was designed to augment an important physiological function to a greater capacity than it can on its own (no matter how much protein or aminos you consume). It does this by assisting your body to signal and accelerate the rate at which it processes the building and re-building of muscle tissue, called protein synthesis. By doing so, you can develop lean body mass at a faster rate, more efficiently. Additionally, and equally important, you should notice a reduction in recovery time after bouts of intense exercise or weight training.\r\n\t\r\n\tTherefore, Bio-Gro should be used daily and consistently over time, just as you would food or other sources of protein. And better yet, so far as the anecdotal reports suggests, the more you use, the better and more profound its effects. \r\n\tIsatori Bio-Gro Directions for Use: \r\n\tAs a dietary supplement, mix one scoop of Bio-Gro twice daily in liquid and thoroughly agitate or blend (clumping likely if stirred in plain water), or mix in soft food (yogurt, oatmeal, etc). Bio-Gro is an unflavored powder that can be taken anytime with or without food. Follow daily usage chart for optimal results.\r\n\tContains milk product (colostrum).Ingredients: None.

Pro-Antium dominates every other protein in its category… GAME OVER! Yeah buddy!*\r\n\t\tWhat kind of protein is in Pro-Antium?\r\n\t\tPRO-ANITUM contains a precise blend of fast, medium, and slow digesting proteins for optimal recovery. The fast digesting whey protein immediately goes to work re-fueling your muscles. The medium digesting egg protein continues to supply high quality protein and amino acids to your muscles after the whey has finished. Lastly, the slow digesting micellar casein protein provides an even steadier and more sustained drip of aminos to your muscles long after your workout is complete.\r\n\t\tWho can use Pro-Antium?\r\n\t\tPro-Antium can be used by both male and female athletes looking for a great tasting, top notch protein formula to help them achieve their bodybuilding and fitness goals. Pro-Antium can also be used by anyone looking for a great tasting way to get extra protein into their diet.\r\n\t\tIs Pro-Antium just a protein formula?\r\n\t\tNO! Pro-Antium is a complete recovery and muscle building formula that contains more than just \"standard\" protein. Big Ron knows the importance of combining ingredients and creating a synergy between them. Along with the precision digestion blend of protein Pro-Antium contains 5g of creatine which is scientifically proven to increase strength, power and athletic performance. This potent formula also contains 13.5g of essential amino acids and 3.5g of BCAAs necessary for muscle growth. The most novel ingredient in this formula is the one that brings all of the other ingredients together and amplifies them… betaine. The 2.5g of betaine in Pro-Antium increases the efficiency rate at which the body absorbs protein, creatine, and amino acids into muscle cells. So, not only does Pro-Antium™ provide you with quality protein, creatine, EAAs and BCAAs but it also makes sure that none of them are wasted by ensuring the uptake and absorption of them.\r\n\t\tWhen should I take Pro-Antium?\r\n\t\tBecause of Pro-Antium's versatile blend of protein and muscle building ingredients it can be taken any time that you required a quality, high protein meal with additional benefits. However, for optimal results Ronnie suggests that males take 1 scoop or 2 scoops with 4-6oz or 8-12oz of water or your favorite beverage. Ronnie suggests that females take 1 scoop with 4-6oz of water or your favorite beverage. Ronnie suggests using 1-4 servings daily making sure that 1 of those servings is taken immediately after your workout. To further increase your protein intake and to create a milkshake-like consistency, try adding fat-free or low-fat milk in place of water. Pro-Antium is also great for getting fuel to your muscles that are in dire need of aminos first thing in the morning after being deprived all night while you slept. Adding Pro-Antium first thing in the morning will help you avoid muscle breakdown.\r\n\t\tDoes Pro-Antium need to be cycled?\r\n\t\tNo, Pro-Antium does NOT need to be cycled. Your body and muscles need protein often and daily in order to metabolize other macro nutrients as well as maintain a lean shape.\r\n\t\tIs there research behind the formula in Pro-Antium?\r\n\t\tYes! All Ronnie Coleman Signature Series products were formulated with ingredients that have been extensively researched with clinical studies. The creatine and betaine included in the Pro-Antium formula have both been scientifically proven to increase strength, power and athletic performance. Also, Pro-Antium is manufactured in the U.S.A. in a cGMP facility. (cGMP stands for current good manufacturing practice)\r\n\t\tWhat other Ronnie Coleman Signature Series can I take with Pro-Antium?\r\n\t\tPro-Antium has been designed to work in combination with all other Ronnie Coleman Signature Series products. In fact, for the best and most noticeable results Ronnie highly suggest stacking all of his products together! (In the case that you are a female Ronnie recommends leaving Testogen-XR™ out of your stack!)\r\n\tCAUTION – READ ENTIRE LABEL BEFORE CONSUMING! DIRECTIONS: Recommended Use for Males: Take 1-2 scoops with 4-6 oz. to 8-12 oz. of cold water or your favorite beverage. Use approximately 4-6 oz. of liquid per 1 scoop of powder. Vary the amount of your chosen liquid to acquire your desired flavor and consistency. Drink 1-4 servings daily, including after your workout to achieve your bodybuilding and fitness goals. To further increase protein intake and to create a milkshake-like consistency, try adding fat-free or low-fat milk in place of water. Recommended Use for Females: Take 1 scoop with 4-6 oz. of cold water or your favorite beverage. Vary the amount of your chosen liquid to acquire your desired flavor and consistency. Drink 1-4 servings daily to aid in your varying fitness goals. To further increase protein intake and to create a milkshake-like consistency, try adding fat-free or low-fat milk in place of water.\r\n\tBefore taking PRO-ANTIUM or any dietary supplement seek advice from your physician if you are unaware of your current health condition, have any pre-existing medical condition(s), taking any medications(s), planning any medical procedure, pregnant, nursing or contemplating pregnancy.

      "text": "Why do you work out? Is it to get better at a sport? Is it to get bigger muscles? Is it to lose bodyfat? No matter what your reason is for working out, we all hit the weights and train our bodies for one specific purpose in mind, to compete. It may be a competition with a friend, a competition against a rival sports team, or even a competition with yourself, but no matter what, the goal is to be the best you can possibly be. Stop wasting your time “exercising”, and take it to the next level…Compete!\r\n\tCompete takes intra-workout supplementation to an entirely new level. The days of using antiquated BCAA’s or bloat inducing high carbohydrate/creatine products is long gone. Featuring clinically proven doses of novel amino acids, whey protein hydrolysate, and focus enhancing compounds, Compete is the perfect answer for any athlete looking to get the edge over their competition.\r\n\t\r\n\tHow Does Compete work?\r\n\tCompete works by addressing the four major necessities to athletic performance:\r\n\tMental Focus | Physical Performance | Recovery | Hydration\r\n\tMental Focus:\r\n\tWhen we exercise our body releases very potent chemicals(like adrenaline) that can cause us to go into our natural “fight or flight” mode. Going into this mode protects us from danger in nature, however it can cause athletic performance to suffer significantly. By augmenting our bodies reaction to exercise/physical stress, we can use these powerful chemicals to our benefit, instead of to our detriment.\r\n\t\r\n\tCompete does just that. Through the use of a potent adaptogen (Rhodiola Rosea), Compete will completely change how your body responds to physical stress, allowing you to reap more benefits each and every workout. Adaptogens are compounds that help our body stay more “calm” in stressful situations. An easy comparison would be to look at adaptogens as if they were “coolant” in a cars radiator. Too little coolant and that car overheats, and eventually stops running. The same goes for the human body, we must keep our mental/physical stress within certain limits to enable us to perform at 100% of our best.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn addition to including a potent adaptogen, Compete makes sure than not only your body is ready to handle stress, but it also includes a powerful alkaloid from the Perwinkle plant known as “Vinpocetine”. Capable of providing users with enhanced brain blood flow, a mood boost, and more energy, the addition of Vinpocetine was crucial to allowing athletes to feel, think, and perform at their absolute peak.\r\n\tPhysical Performance:\r\n\tNow while we all know it’s great to feel good when we work out, our actual physical performance is what matters at the end of the day. To increase our overall physical performance, we need to manipulate numerous bodily functions, not just 1 in specific. Compete does this by utilizing clinical doses of the most impressive athletic enhancers currently known to science, two forms of L-Carnitine.\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine works by forcing fatty acids into our cells mitochondria, where they can then be oxidized and burned for additional energy/power. By doing this, Carnitine will allow your body to create more energy(thus reducing fatigue), burn more fat, and work better/faster at your activity of choice.\r\n\tWhile other products may use simple L-Carnitine, Compete uses far a more bioavailable & effective form, L-Carnitine Fumarate.\r\n\tL-Carnitine Fumarate: One of the newest forms of L-Carnitine, L-Carnitine Fumarate is the ultimate choice for enhancing athletic performance. This compound is a simple combination of L-Carnitine & Fumaric acid, however its effects are nothing less than incredible. This form of Carnitine gives you all the benefits listed above, however it also brings with it massive improvements on our ATP(think of it like gasoline/fuel for our cells) production. Fumaric acid significantly increases ATP production, so this means each of our cells will be able to produce more energy or “fuel” during your workouts. This means more energy and more performance during your work out and all day long!\r\n\tIn addition to simply needing more energy production while we exercise, we also need to protect our muscles (and therefor our physical performance) as workouts can be extremely catabolic(muscle wasting). When we exercise, our body pulls from both our fat and muscle to help fuel our movement. While this is how our body is supposed to work, it is counterproductive for athletes to reach their max potential. To prevent this catabolism, it’s necessary to introduce amino acids into our body while we train. The most effective form of amino acid administration has been shown to be in small amino acid chains, like those found only in Hydrolyzed protein. Compete contains the highest grade Whey Protein Hydrolysate to ensure that you remain anabolic throughout the entirety of your workout. This means more fat being burned, and more muscle being preserved!\r\n\t\r\n\tRecovery:\r\n\tAlthough our workout itself seems like the most important aspect of increasing our performance, our rate of recovery has just as much of an effect on our performance. Think about it, if you train your heart out to the point that you can’t walk straight for 3-4 days, how well can you really perform during those 3-4 days? Not very well…\r\n\t\r\n\tCompete comes loaded to the gills with clinical doses of yet another form of Carnitine that has been shown to do everything from reduce recovery time(less soreness!) to increase the sensitivity of our androgen receptors(quicker gains)!\r\n\t\r\n\tL-Carnitine L-Tartrate: The most tried and proven form of Carnitine, L-Carnitine L-Tartrate has been making waves in the supplement industry as one of the most effective dietary supplements currently available. Capable of providing instantaneous improvements in your recovery, the massive dosing of this compound will have you not only performing at your best during your workouts, but will have you ready to attack your next workout at 100% intensity without any down time!\r\n\t\r\n\tHydration:\r\n\tYou’ve heard it before…hydration is one of the most important aspects of performing your best. When we exercise, we sweat, which means we lose massive amounts of water and thus dehydrate ourselves during exercise. While we know it’s important, do you really understand just how important it is? Losing just 20% of our water stores can reduce our athletic performance by up to 50%! So, we know we need to drink more water to stay hydrated, however most of us don’t realize it’s also necessary to add in extra minerals, electrolytes, and phosphates to ensure we stay as hydrated as possible.\r\n\t\r\n\tCompete contains perfect amounts of electrolytes to help your body stay hydrated and keep your engines running at redline. Electrolytes are what allows our brain to communicate with the rest of our body, as they allow conductivity of the electrical signals. Without ample amounts of electrolytes, our muscles can begin to cramp and “give out” due to our brain no longer being able to communicate with them effectively. Compete will help reduce the chance of cramping, and make sure you stay hydrated through even the most intense competitions!\r\n\t\r\n\tSimply put, the ultimate product is here. No hype, no nonsense…just clinical doses of scientifically proven ingredients. Don’t just exercise…Compete!\r\n\tWorkout days: Mix 1-2 servings of Compete in ice cold water (approximately 10-20oz per serving based on your individual taste preference) and sip during your workout or sport of choice. Compete is intended to completely replace water during your exercise period, so it may be beneficial to refill your container with additional water once you've finished ½ of your Compete for that day. Non-workout days: Mix 1-2 servings of Compete in ice cold water (10-20oz per serving based on your individual taste preference) and sip throughout the day, or as a tasty drink at any time of the day!\r\n\tDo not exceed recommended dose. Consult with physician prior to use if you are taking medications, including but not limited to MAOI inhibitors, antidepressants, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or products containing phylephrine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or other stimulants. Consult your physician prior to use if you have a medical condition, including but not limited to, heart, liver, kidney, or thyroid disease, psychiatric or epileptic disorders, difficulty urinating, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, recurrent headaches, enlarged prostate or glaucoma. Discontinue 2 weeks prior to surgery or if you experience rapid heartbeat, dizziness, severe headache, or shortness of breath.

If you only took one supplement ever for muscle growth, it might definitely be creatine. German Creatine is for athletes who take creatine and want to ensure purity so their creatine is free from harmful contaminants and contains exactly what is on the label.    After years of going back and forth about “the best kind of creatine”, nothing has stood the test of time and research better than creatine monohydrate. For such a well recognized and inexpensive supplement, don’t settle for anything less than the most pure form available. German Creatine is made with 100% Creapure®, manufactured in Germany under strict GMP conditions, and verified for purity using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. The end result is the highest purity level ever achieved in the world - a minimum 99.95%.    Only Creapure® has been investigated in more than 50 clinical trials supporting its short term safety. And numerous clinical trials have supported Creapure's® long term safety as well. No toxic effects have ever been determined from Creapure® testing. The same cannot be said for other Creatines on the market that do not contain Creapure®.    When it comes to Creatine, purity matters. Creatine Monohydrate is one of the top consumed supplement in sports. Such tight competition has lead to chinese manufacturers cutting corners to save money. These lower quality creatines contain higher levels of harmful impurities, such as Dicyandiamide (DCD), Dihydrotriazine (DHT), Creatinine, Thiourea, and Sodium.    If you only took one supplement ever for muscle growth, it might definitely be creatine. German Creatine is for athletes who take creatine and want to pay slightly more to ensure that their creatine is free from harmful contaminants.    ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the cell's main source of energy. During exercise this is depleted and converted to ADP. Under normal conditions it can take several hours to reverse this process by the metabolism of sugars. Creatine speeds up this process be supplying the needed phosphate to convert ADP back to ATP instantly. The result is longer workouts with greater muscular energy stores.*These statements have not been evaluated                  by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "text": "TT-33 is part of the new wave of stimulant free fat burners aimed at athletes who want jitter free thermogenesis but without the unwanted reduced potency.\r\n\t\tIForce created this stimulant free fat burner to target stored fat tissue preferentially to be used as a source of energy substrates. Meaning that your hard earned muscle is protected whilst dieting and maximising potential fat loss when the body is in a state of calorie deficit.\r\n\t\tCreating a calorie deficit is simple, consume less nutrients or increase your energy expenditure. A balance of the two is what many professionals recommend and it certainly does work, but sometimes when you reach a plateau it can be difficult to make the extra sacrifice and cut more calories or increase cardio further...hence why so many choose thermogenics to solve this problem.\r\n\t\tThe problem with some strong fat burners is that they are heavily stimulant based and can make you feel jittery but do deliver fantastic results. Fortunately IForce have harnessed and controlled the power of naturally occurring iodo-thyronines.\r\n\t\tIodo-thyronines rapidly augment your BMR (Basic Metabolic Rate) increasing the amount of calories expended and putting your metabolism into overdrive. A worth while mentioning also must be made about TT-33's mega dose of vitamin b12 aka methylcobalamin, this micronutrient is believed to deliver fast rises in mental focus and clarity as well as providing your brain with oxygen-rich red blood cells ensuring even on low carbohydrate dieters you still have the ability to focus on your daily tasks.\r\n\tNON-STIMULANT MENTAL FOCUS!\r\n\tBy adding a significant dose of Methylcobalamin to each serving of TT-33, users report a quick rise in mental focus and clarity, along with increased oxygen effeciency. Methylcobalamin plays a key role in brain function as well as the production of oxygen-rich red blood cells.\r\n\tBURN FAT, NOT MUSCLE!\r\n\tYou spend hours in the gym and in the kitchen building quality muscle mass, don't let a \"kitchen sink\" fat burner burn all your hard earned muscle gains. TT-33's UMAD-Complex features compounds that specifically target fat tissue by releasing a surge of \"uncoupling proteins.\" These proteins preferentially act on stored fat cells, which insures the muscle you have built will not be burned!\r\n\tStack It!                     \r\n\tBecause TT-33 is a non-stimulant product, you can easily stack it with Adipoxil. This can not only increase the overall thermogenic effect, but also it will preferentially shift all of that calorie burning to your stored fat instead of your muscle!\r\n\tConsume 1 capsule 2-4 times per day, spaced evenly throughout the day. Do not exceed 4 weeks of continuous use.\r\n\tThis dietary supplement is only intended to be consumed by healthy adults 21 (twenty one) years of age or older. Consult your health care professional before using this or any other food supplement. Follow the directions on the label and do not exceed suggested dosages under any circumstances ever.

      "text": "Why Spend Your Money on a Nitric Oxide Product and a Fat Burner When You Can Get the Best of Both In ANADROX\r\n\tANADROX “PUMP & BURN”™ is the world's first supplement to combine the power of Nitric Oxide (NO) with a potent full spectrum Fat Burning Matrix in one breakthrough formula to simultaneously trigger extreme muscle growth and pumps, while activating a powerful vasothermic fat loss reaction. ANADROX combines two patent protected exclusive compounds, NitroFolin™ and Thermo-Z7™, for the most powerful surge of Nitric Oxide and extreme fat burning in one revolutionary formula!\r\n\t\r\n\tANADROX’S patent protected NitroFolin is the most powerful Nitric Oxide generator available for increasing muscle fiber expansion, pumps and vascularity. This surge of Nitric Oxide also provides the ultimate transport system for ANADROX’s potent fat burning matrix, Thermo-Z7™. Nitric Oxide works as a fat burning catalyst by flooding your veins and igniting this powerful fat burning compound, even further increasing its effectiveness for rapid fat loss and deep cut muscle striations beyond physiological normality.\r\n\t\r\n\tANADROX pushes Nitric Oxide production beyond physiological normality, allowing bodybuilders to experience the most immense muscle pumps ever. ANADROX contains the powerful Nitric Oxide booster, NitroFolin, the only compound with the ability to override the body’s NO agonists (restrictors) for an unprecedented perpetual pump! Here is how this amazingly powerful compound works:\r\n\t\r\n\tWhile arginine and arginine derivatives such as AAKG are the “raw materials” used by the body to produce Nitric Oxide, there are many interactions along the Nitric Oxide pathway which influence Nitric Oxide production: homocysteine, ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine), SOA (super oxide anion), SOD (super oxide dismutase) and perhaps the most critical of all NOS (nitric oxide synthase). The relationship between these co-factors has a direct influence on the amount of arginine that can be converted (synthesized) to Nitric Oxide. No matter how much arginine or arginine substrates (i.e. AAKG, arginine malate, arginine ethyl ester) you feed your body, the amount of Nitric Oxide you can produce is limited to these Nitric Oxide pathway co-factors. In other words, while arginine is the fuel, these co-factors are the parts that make up the Nitric Oxide engine. The discovery of an amazing new compound, Biofolin, allows us to over- ride all Nitric Oxide agonists for significantly greater NO production.\r\n\t\r\n\tBiofolin is an amazing newly discovered patented compound that has the unique ability to maximize the conversion of arginine to NO by augmenting all of the co-factors involved in arginine’s conversion to Nitric Oxide within the pathway. The discovery of Biofolin, a powerful, novel compound, is regarded by many in the medical field as the biggest breakthrough ever in inducing Nitric Oxide production. And now, it’s being made available to bodybuilders and athletes exclusively in MHP products.\r\n\tANADROX’s Vasothemic Fat Burning Breakthrough!\r\n\t\r\n\tStep 1. The infusion of Nitric Oxide generated by NitroFolin, creates the ideal environment for extreme fat burning. Nitric Oxide's vasodilation effect increases blood flow and provides the ultimate transport system for Thermo-Z7.\r\n\tStep 2. The simultaneous infusion of Nitric Oxide and Thermo-Z7 creates a plasma shift, thereby elevating the concentration and effects of these powerful clinically proven fat burning metabolites. This VasoThermic reaction makes ANADROX the world’s most powerful fat burning catalyst.\r\n\tStep 3. Clinically proven Advantra-Z? triggers the beta-receptors to release Adrenaline and Noradrenaline, igniting the Fat Burning process while beta receptor upregulators enhance this thermogenic process.\r\n\tStep 4. Proprietary matrix stimulates the activation of Hormone Sensitive Lipase, which in turn signals your body to free up stored fat.\r\n\tStep 5. Attacks the freed up fat stores and starts breaking them up into smaller fatty acids, preparing their demise.\r\n\tStep 6. Increases thermogenic enzymatic activity with clinically proven 7-Keto, creating a superior fat burning environment.\r\n\tStep 7. NitroFolin and Thermo-Z7 combo allows for maximum fatty acid oxidation.\r\n\tAs a dietary supplement, take 4 capsules once or twice daily. For maximum results, take 4 capsules in the morning and 4 capsules in the afternoon. Store at 15-30 degrees C (59-86 degrees F).\r\n\tNot intended for use by persons under age 18.

With zero fat, cholesterol or sugar, you need to beef up with Carnivor – the world's first beef protein isolate!\r\n\t\r\n\tIt has long been known that bodybuilders and strength athletes consume high amounts of beef to help build muscle and increase strength. The muscle building power of beef cannot be disputed. Ask any bodybuilder and they will tell you that they make their biggest muscle gains and feel their strongest when they eat beef. Now, thanks to the development of an advanced bioengineered beef protein, MuscleMeds has formulated the most sought after muscle building protein ever created. Carnivor is unlike any other protein in existence.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe world's first all beef protein isolate is more concentrated than whe\r\n\tUsing new advanced extraction, clarification, hydrolysis and isolation technologies Carnivor's Beef Protein Isolate delivers the muscle-building power of beef with higher amino acid levels than all other protein sources used in supplements including: whey, soy, milk and egg. Carnivor Beef Protein Isolate is even 350% more concentrated in anabolic muscle-building aminos than a prime sirloin steak!\r\n\t\r\n\tAnabolic Nitrogen Retention Technology (ARNT) recycles aminos and minimizes ammonia\r\n\tANRT is a major muscle-building breakthrough in protein supplementation. While protein is critical for muscle growth, paradoxically, protein can sometimes actually decrease performance and muscle growth if nitrogenous waste products like ammonia are not recycled back into anabolic tissue-building pathways or otherwise neutralized. ANRT is specially designed to allow the recycling of aminos back toward the muscle building pathway and prevent the build-up of debilitating toxic scavengers such as ammonia. ANRT nitrogen retention factors contained in Carnivor include: GKG (glutamine-alpha-ketoglutarate), OKG (ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate), AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate) and KIC (alpha-ketoisocaproate).\r\n\t\r\n\t20-times the creatine content of steak\r\n\tOne of the attributes of eating beef is its naturally high creatine content. Beef is one of the best natural sources of creatine. To push the anabolic activation and cell volumizing effects of creatine even greater, each serving of Carnivor supplies 20 times more creatine than whole beef food sources to saturate your muscles for explosive strength and growth.\r\n\t\r\n\tAdded BCAA for increased anabolic and anti-catabolic effects\r\n\tTo further boost the anabolic, muscle-building action of Carnivor, additional Branch Chain Amino Acids are added to the purified Beef Protein Isolate. The enhanced BCAA levels promote a positive nitrogen balance, increase protein synthesis, decrease catabolism, improve workout performance and reduce muscle fatigue.\r\n\t\r\n\tThroughout history, the ravenous appetite that \"men of muscle\" have for top quality beef has become as legendary as their super-human feats. Ancient warriors, Greek Olympic athletes, strongmen like Sandow and even Roman gladiators craved and consumed pounds of beef per day to build muscle to boost their combat prowess. Now, in modern times this muscle-building nutrition carries on in the bodybuilding world with Carnivor!\r\n\tBeef Protein Isolate is More Concentrated Than Steak and More Concentrated Than Whey\r\n\tUsing extraction, clarification, hydrolysis and isolation technologies CARNIVOR's Bioengineered Beef Protein Isolate delivers the muscle building power of beef with higher amino acid levels than many other protein sources used in supplements including whey, soy, milk and egg. CARNIVOR Beef Protein Isolate is even more concentrated in anabolic muscle building aminos than a prime sirloin steak! And it has no fat or cholesterol!\r\n\tAnabolic Nitrogen Retention Technology (ANRT) Recyles Aminos and Minimizes Ammonia\r\n\tWhile protein is critical for muscle growth, paradoxically, consuming more protein can sometimes actually decrease performance and muscle growth if nitrogenous waste products like ammonia are not recycled back into anabolic tissue building pathways or otherwise neutralized. ANRT is specially designed to promote the recycling of aminos back toward the muscle-building pathway to address the build-up of debilitating toxic scavengers such as ammonia. ANRT nitrogen retention factors contained in Carnivor include: GKG (Glutamine-alpha-ketoglutarate), OKG (Ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate), AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate) and KIC (alpha-ketoisocaproate).\r\n\tCarnivor was formulated to support the recycling of aminos back into the muscle building pathways to support nitrogen retention and promotion of muscle growth and performance.\r\n\tFor a delicious protein shake, mix 1 Carnivor with 6-8 oz. of cold water in a shaker bottle.

      "text": "Build Muscle & Strength with this Complete Anabolic Stack\r\n\tMass FX is a complete anabolic stack designed for all drug-free and tested athletes. It boosts testosterone, reduces estrogen, intensifies insulin, and naturally enriches your blood with more erythropoietin (EPO) – the secret oxygen-enhancing hormone doped by endurance athletes around the World.\r\n\tIn just four weeks, Mass FX can help you build solid, natural muscle; the kind of muscle that gets you noticed; the kind of muscle that moves serious weight in the weight room. And the kind of muscle that helps you hit new PR’s.\r\n\tIncrease Muscle-Building Testosterone\r\n\tDid you know that 90% of your testosterone is useless? It can’t build muscle or strength because it’s locked up by Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) – a protein in your blood used by the body to regulate your levels. .But the ingredients in Mass FX block SHBG from binding with your testosterone,  thus increasing free testosterone in your blood (the ONLY testosterone that counts). With the cutting edge testosterone boosting ingredient Methyl EAA™, MassFX helps your body produce more testosterone and then ensures it is unleashed into Free testosterone where it can be used with proper training, to increase muscle mass and size. .\r\n\tIntensify the Master Anabolic Hormone – Insulin\r\n\tTo build big muscle – bigger than testosterone can build alone – you need to intensify the insulin response. That’s why Mass FX contains BMOV. BMOV mimics insulin, improves insulin sensitivity, and intensifies the insulin response. And this helps load your muscles with the amino acids and glycogen they need to grow as big as your testosterone is telling them to.\r\n\tBoost EPO & Muscle Oxygenation\r\n\tEndurance athletes have known it all along. Boosting EPO – a natural hormone in the body – is the key to dominating endurance events. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (RBCs), which carry oxygen to working muscles. More RBCs equals gives you more oxygen, which equals gives you more aerobic power, greater muscular endurance and faster recovery.\r\n\tNow you can do the same – without a grand jury inquisition! losing the Tour de France Title! Mass FX contains chelated cobalt, a safe and natural EPO-stimulating element proven to significantly boost RBC production.\r\n\tWhat to Expect\r\n\t3-5 days. That’s all it takes. Not 2-3 weeks like other testosterone boosters. In 3-5 days, Mass FX begins to work. Initially, you’ll feel a rise in confidence. We call this the “alpha male” mentality. And it grows stronger each week. During your second week, you’ll notice larger than normal improvements in strength compared to the week before. By day 12, your body will be producing almost 50% more testosterone. And, with improved aerobic power kicking in during week 3, Mass FX will help you exhaust your muscles even further, which forces them to get even bigger.\r\n\tThe Science\r\n\tThere are two major ways to increase muscle growth. One, you can increase free testosterone, which binds to special receptors on your muscles and tells them to grow. Two, you can boost training intensity, which tells your muscles to adapt, get stronger, and grow bigger. Mass FX helps you do both.\r\n\tMass FX significantly increases testosterone and free testosterone. It also boosts blood-oxygen content so you can train harder and exhaust your muscles even more. Combined, this intensifies muscle growth signaling. And, by improving the insulin response, Mass FX can load your muscles with all the nutrients they need to grow as big as they’re being told to grow.\r\n\tFrequently Asked Questions\r\n\tQ: Who is Mass FX for?\r\n\tA: Mass FX is made specifically for natural and drug-tested athletes age 18 and older. It’s designed for individuals looking\r\n\tto increase anabolic hormones inside their body, and to do so without using pro-hormones and/or anabolic steroids.\r\n\tQ: What is Methyl-EAA™?\r\n\tA: Methyl-EAA™, or N-Methyl-aspartic acid, is a derivative of D-Aspartic acid – an amino acid that is clinically proven to boost testosterone production in men by 42% in 12 days. D-Aspartic acid works, in part, by stimulating and “exciting” the NMDA receptors in the brain. N-Methyl-aspartic acid, however, is 50x stronger at stimulating the NMDA receptor. This means a lower dose of N-Methyl-Aspartic acid is required to elicit a testosterone response (compared to regular DAspartic acid), which helps us extend a cost-savings to you.\r\n\tQ: I am an endurance athlete. Will I test positive for blood doping by using Cobalt amino acid chelate?\r\n\tA: No. Cobalt is an all-natural element that helps your body naturally increase production of EPO (Erythropoietin hormone) and red blood cells.\r\n\tQ: What is the difference between testosterone and “free” testosterone?\r\n\tA: In your body, testosterone exists in two states – bound and free. When testosterone is “bound,” that means a globular protein called Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) has attached itself to your testosterone. When this happens, your testosterone is no longer “free,” which means your testosterone can’t bind to specialized sites on your muscles (called androgen receptors) and tell your muscle to grow. “Free” testosterone is the opposite. It is “free” from SHBG, and therefore, free to bind to your androgen receptors and tell your muscles to grow. The more free testosterone you have, the more your muscles are told to grow, and this is highly beneficial for strength and muscle development.\r\n\tQ: Is Mass FX a pro-hormone or steroid, and will it require post cycle therapy (PCT) when I’m done?\r\n\tA: No. Mass FX is a natural anabolic formula specifically designed for natural and drug-tested athletes. Because Mass FX helps your body produce more testosterone, it is safe to use, and does not require a PCT following use.\r\n\tQ: How old do I have to be to use Mass FX?\r\n\tA: Mass FX is ideal for anyone over the age of 18.\r\n\tQ: Will Mass FX increase my sex drive?\r\n\tA: Yes, and it’s not uncommon for users to report an increase in erection quality, too.\r\n\tQ: Isn’t Boron a bogus ingredient?\r\n\tA: Boron has gotten a bad rap over the years. Of course, any ingredient that is under dosed will. But according to sports scientists at the University of Medical Sciences in Teheran, men between the ages of 29-50 taking 10mg of boron for 10 days experienced a 28% increase in free testosterone and a 39% decrease in estradiol. And so, that is the precise dose you will find in Mass FX. 10mg of Boron every day!\r\n\tQ: Does Mass FX lower estrogen?\r\n\tA: Yes, Mass FX lowers estrogen by using three ingredients with strong anti-aromatase effects. Those ingredients include 7-Methoxyflavone, Zinc and Vitamin D3. Aromatase is an enzyme in your body. When aromatase interacts with testosterone, it converts your testosterone into estrogen. Ingredients such as zinc and 7-Methoxyflavone bind to the aromatase enzyme, and turn it off. In other words, aromatase can no longer bind to testosterone. Vitamin D3, on the other hand, works at the genetic level, and tells your body to produce less aromatase. The net effect is a healthy and highly advantageous reduction in estrogen.\r\n\tMass FX Ingredient Descriptions\r\n\t\r\n\tZinc (as Zinc Amino Acid Chelate): A mineral that supports testosterone, libido and estrogen reduction.\r\n\tVitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol): Modulates the endocrine system to support testosterone and reduce estrogen.\r\n\tBoron (as Boron Citrate): A mineral that boosts testosterone and supports joints during hard training.\r\n\tUDAX™ (Urtica SHBG Lignan Complex): 3,4-divanillyltetrahydrofuran lignan extract that increases free testosterone, which triggers muscle growth.\r\n\t7-MF (7-Methoxyflavone): An all-natural aromatase inhibitor which reduces bad estrogen. This is the active flavone in Chrysin, used for decades to reduce estrogen.\r\n\tMethyl EAA™ (N-Methyl-aspartic acid): With 50x greater potency, this derivative of D-Aspartic acid increases testosterone and HGH.\r\n\tVanadium (as BMOV Bis-[Maltolato]oxovanadium[IV]): A glucose disposal agent, BMOV improves insulin sensitivity and builds glycogen in muscles.\r\n\tCobalt (as Cobalt Amino Acid Chelate): Naturally boosts EPO and red blood cells to increase muscle oxygenation.\r\n\tTheobromine: Found in chocolate, theobromine increases vasodilation and oxygen/nutrient flow to muscles."

This gold standard, 8-week, double blind, placebo controlled study showed an increase in chest size of 1 inch and 4.5 times as much lean muscle mass than the placebo group.\r\n\tQUICKMASS LOADED accomplishes this by combining a scientifically proven calorie level with a new calorie activation system called NP5™ Technology. Every angle of the QUICKMASS LOADED formula has been custom designed with the sole objective of delivering the strongest, most potent mass gainer in existence today! We at ALLMAX Nutrition feel we have accomplished our mission – you be the judge!\r\n\tThis means consuming a huge amount of quality calories. Simply put, if you’re not consuming more calories than your body is burning, you will not gain mass – you can’t argue with this fact! QUICKMASS LOADED works by providing a precise 1010 calories per serving (four scoops) with custom engineered nutrient matrixes that set the standard in mass gainers.\r\n\tQuickMass Loaded goes to work by providing a precise 1010 calories per serving made up of the following unique custom engineered macronutrient blends:\r\n\tOCTA-PRO™ - 8-STAGE Protein Delivery Matrix\r\n\tUnderstanding the importance of trickling amino acids into the bloodstream over an extended period of time, QuickMass® Loaded contains 55 grams of an 8-STAGE nitrogen delivery system.

OxyElite Protein Powder is not only a delicious low fat, great tasting protein powder to support muscle building and recovery. But it also contains added digestive enzymes, essential fatty acids and additional ingredients to help burn fat.\r\n\tIncludes THE Highest Quality (80%) Whey protein Concentrate Available\r\n\tDid you know that Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) is available between 34% - 80% protein content? Unless your protein label specifically states what % it is, you may be consuming the cheap stuff that has higher lactose (milk sugar) and other unwanted byproducts. OxyELITE Protein includes premium WPC 80%.\r\n\tUpgraded with CLA and MCT\r\n\tOxyELITE Protein not only contains the best possible proteins, but it is also upgraded with:\r\n\t• Conjugated Linoleic Ac id (CLA): Known to possess anti-lipogenic activity in fat cells.\r\n\t• Medium Chain T riglycerides (MCT): Shown to increase diet-induced thermogenesis.\r\n\tAnti-Catabolic Blend of Fast and Slow Digesting Proteins\r\n\tYou want to get lean. Unfortunately, if most of your protein supplementation is just whey (or any singular protein source) you might be putting yourself at a significant disadvantage. OxyELITE Protein contains Milk Protein Isolate (MPI), a premium protein that contains various proteins, namely whey and casein. The protein combination found in MPI has been shown to have greater satiating ability, greater nitrogen retention, greater leaning potential and greater lean muscle impact than whey or casein alone.\r\n\tNo CHEAP FILLER AMINO BLENDS DISGUISED AS PROTEIN\r\n\tOxyELITE Protein is also world-class for what it doesn’t contain. Due to a test developed in the 1800s and still used today, your protein may be loaded with cheap “filler” aminos such as glycine, alanine and taurine. They can be added to protein because when analyzed using these dated tests, they increase the total nitrogen content of the product, making it appear as if it has more protein than it really does. Run, don’t walk, from amino blends added to protein products.\r\n\tGo check the label of your current protein\r\n\tOne or more of these ingredients could be the reason why you’re not reaching your goals as fast as you would like:\r\n\tMaltode xtrin (i.e. glucose polymers) – While not technically a sugar, this additive registers higher on the Glycemic Index scale than a slice of white bread!\r\n\tCreamers (with corn syrup solids & hydrogenated fats) – You know that thick, fatty liquid polluted with corn syrup solids and evil hydrogenated fats some put in their coffee? Yeah, it’s in many proteins as well because it’s cheap and improves taste (it’s also loaded with fat and sugar). OxyELITE Protein Contains No Added Maltodextrin, Corn Syrup or Hydrogenated Fats*\r\n\tOXYELITE PROTEIN Directions\r\n\tTake 1 scoop (equaling approximately 23 grams of protein) with 6 oz. of cold water or any beverage of your choice. Use approximately 6 oz of liquid per scoop of powder. You may vary the amount of liquid to achieve your desired flavor and consistency. Drink 1 serving daily, or as needed to satisfy your protein requirements. To increase your protein intake per serving and to achieve an amazing milk shake taste, use non-fat or low fat milk.\r\n\tAllergen Information: Contains milk and soy (lecithin) ingredients.

      "text": "PRESURGE\r\n\tPRE-SURGE  Highlights:\r\n\tIntensity, Energy & Focus:\r\n\tPreSurge approach:\r\n\tStimulant/Cognitive Focus Blend:\r\n\tContaining caffeine (225mg), dendrobium extract and rauwolfia (standardized for alpha-yohimbine) for powerful intensity and focus.\r\n\t\r\n\tL-theanine- L-theanine stimulates alpha wave activity in the brain and has been shown when combined with caffeine to be highly beneficial in improving speed, accuracy and alertness during demanding tasks. The ultimate combination for boosting neurological performance and the “mind muscle connection” that is crucially needed in the gym. Instead of using any cheap generic l-theanine, we went all out and licensed the exact same patented l- theanine (Suntheanin®) brand used in the research. And we dosed it in PreSurge to mimic the doses they found to be effective in the research. As an additional benefit, L-theanine has been shown in research to accelerate mental regeneration after exercise and reduce the negative side effects of caffeine. The perfect supplement to combat exercise induced neurological burnout that occurs to so many people when training hard and heavy. Additionally, it is the perfect addition to combat and offset potential burnout that can occur when using caffeine and the other stimulants contained in PreSurge.\r\n\t\r\n\tNeuravena- Another core component of our intensity, energy, focus blend, is the brain boosting ingredient Neuravena®. Neuravena is a wild green oat extract, that utilizes specific constituents of the plant that have a high degree of biological activity in relation to the two central nervous system enzymes, monoamine oxidase B(MAO-B) and phosphodiesterase 4(PDE 4). Research in humans has shown that Neuravena inhibits these two enzymes, which in turn will boost the neurotransmitter dopamine and the chemical messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP). The overall benefit of boosting these two are: enhanced alertness, greater energy and focus. The perfect mental state you need to be during your workout to push through plateaus.\r\n\t\r\n\tTo add some more grunt to the blend and to further crank up your energy and intensity levels, we added the energy boosters and neurotransmitter precursors, phenylalanine (DLPA), tyrosine, taurine, Glycine, TMG for the ultimate Pre-Workout energy blend.\r\n\r\n\tOld School Pre-Workout Formula:\r\n\tGeneric Low Grade Creatine Or Inferior Forms\r\n\tOld School pre-workout formula:\r\n\tPreSurge Solution\r\n\tRussian Tarragon Extract, No Carbs Needed!\r\n\tFAQ:\r\n\tQ: How will PreSurge improve my workouts, maximizing my gains?\r\n\tQ-Don’t I have to load up on creatine?\r\n\tQ- Why didn’t AEN use some of the “supposedly superior forms of creatine, such as creatine ethyl ester (CEE)?\r\n\tQ- To maximize creatine’s absorption, don’t I need to consume it with simple sugars?\r\n\tQ: Who can benefit from PreSurge?\r\n\tQ: Can I take PreSurge late at night?Ingredients: Citric Acid, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Sucralose, Calcium Silicate, Beet Juice Powder (Color), Acesulfame Potassium. *These statements have not been evaluated \r\n               by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "text": "DARK RAGE establishes a new standard in pre-workout supplementation with our exclusive EPO Blood Building Technology™ and an amazing array of  powerful , advanced, next generation ingredients designed to help take your workouts to a level of intensity, strength,  growth, anabolic muscle pumps and fast recovery that you’ve never experienced before!\r\n\tThe Secret Techniques Used by Bodybuilding’s Freaks that Help Trigger Blood Engorging, Vein Popping Muscle Pumps and Drive Muscle Growth!\r\n\tEPO Blood Volume\r\n\tDARK RAGE introduces a new pump inducing technology that goes beyond nitric oxide. Compounds called Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) are being used by bodybuilding’s elite to induce muscle pumps and stimulate muscle growth beyond nitric oxide and unlike anything else ever used.. These ESAs have been a closely guarded secret of the bodybuilding underground because they help push physiological limits to the edge. DARK RAGE is the first ESA that blows the cover on this closely guarded secret. Bodybuilders are reporting amazing pumps and gains in rock hard muscle ever.\r\n\tWhat makes DARK RAGE’s pump so intense is its ability to stimulate the release of erythropoietin (EPO), which increases red blood cell production and blood volume. The truth is that a pump is the result of delivering more blood to muscle tissue, so while the use of Nitric Oxide (NO) stimulating ingredients like AAKG and Arginine can be effective by causing vasodilation, they do NOT increase blood volume. DARK Rage’s dual EPO-NO action causes what scientists refer to as hemodynamic blood plasma vasodilation. What this means is a larger supply of EPO induced blood is simultaneously being transported through nitric oxide induced vasodilated veins and capillaries to muscle tissue. This increased blood supply not only increases the size and effects of the muscle pump, but it also has a profound muscle building effect as it helps feed your muscle tissue with DARK RAGE’s other active ingredients like creatine, beta-alanine, BCAAs,  Arginine and more. Furthermore, increased blood supply also means increased oxygen supply, so it will help enhance muscle performance and delay muscle fatigue.\r\n\tThe Bottom Line is Nitric Oxide Isn’t Always Enough… To Build More Muscle and Better Pumps, You Need to Build More Blood with Dark Rage’s EPO Technology!!\r\n\tDark Rage’s EPO Blood Building Technology is just one of the major advancements that makes it a superior pre-workout formula! In the development of DARK RAGE, MHP’s research and development team set out to formulate an MHP product that would surpass all others in not only pumps, but also in energy, workout intensity, muscle power, muscle endurance, growth and recovery. After extensive research, MHP’s R&D team accomplished their goal by customizing proprietary compounds to address the important physiological and psychological variables required for maximum workout intensity, power and endurance. These customized proprietary compounds are formulated and balanced to elicit extremely powerful effects and prime your body and mind for the ultimate workout experience.\r\n\tDARK RAGE sets a new scientific standard of pre-workout supplementation with exclusive Technology and an amazingly powerful combination of advanced, next generation ingredients designed to take your workouts to an entirely new level of intensity, increased strength, extreme muscle growth, incredible anabolic muscle pumps and fast recovery!

GH FREAK™ is a cutting-edge Growth Hybrid Sleep Supplement and is formulated to promote healthy sleeping patterns and greater rest and recovery!\r\n\tThe Science Behind The Key Ingredients in the GH FREAK™ Formula\r\n\tGABA (Gamma-Aminobutryic Acid)\r\n\tGABA (Gamma-Aminobutryic Acid) is a neurotransmitter that helps nerve impulses communicate. In the central nervous system, GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter and is known to exert sedative effects. GABA is also involved in regular healthy hormone production in the body.\r\n\tDHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone)\r\n\tDHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone that is produced in the adrenal glands. As individuals age, DHEA levels decrease. DHEA supplementation has been shown to support healthy DHEA levels in the body.\r\n\t5-HTP (5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan)\r\n\t5-HTP is the intermediate metabolite between L-tryptophan and serotonin. 5-HTP can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase central nervous system (CNS) synthesis of serotonin. Healthy serotonin levels are associated with deep, restful sleep.\r\n\tL-THEANINE (5-N-ethyl-glutamine)\r\n\tL-theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid found in tea and is often used to help reduce occasional stress. Research shows that L-theanine can promote healthy alpha-wave production in the brain, which is known to have relaxing effects.\r\n\tMELATONIN (N-Acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine)\r\n\tMelatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the body in the pineal gland of the brain. The release of melatonin correlates with the body's cycle of day and night, with the highest levels of melatonin produced at night. Melatonin can help regulate the sleep cycle, and healthy melatonin levels are known to be important to restful sleep and recovery.\r\n\tNIACIN (3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid, Nicotinic Acid)\r\n\tNiacin is an essential B vitamin and is a factor in the maintenance of good health.\r\n\tGH FREAK FAQ\r\n\tCAN GH FREAK BE STACKED WITH OTHER SUPPLEMENTS?\r\n\tYes. GH FREAK can be stacked with other supplements. For a potent muscle-building stack, many bodybuilders and athletes stack GH FREAK with TEST FREAK!\r\n\tGH FREAK Directions For Use\r\n\tDIRECTIONS: Take 3-5 capsules at or before bedtime, with 8 ounces of water.\r\n\t \r\n\t\tWARNINGS: KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

      "text": "Formulated specially for athletes, Activite delivers a full spectrum infusion of “activated” vitamins, amino acid chelated minerals and high ORAC antioxidants for support for improved muscle recovery. Another key feature is Anabolase®, the patented interactive food optimizer that helps maximize carbohydrate, protein and fat utilization for gains in lean muscle, energy and endurance.\r\n\t• Aminogen®: Enhances Protein Breakdown and Utilization\r\n\t• Carbogen®: Enhances Carbohydrate Breakdown and Utilization\r\n\t• Lipolase®: Enhances Fat Breakdown and Utilization\r\n\tEveryone knows the importance of taking a multi-vitamin and mineral for general health, but as an athlete or fitness enthusiast, you want more than just general health. You want to increase lean body mass, reduce body fat, increase energy and endurance and maximize performance. You work out and eat properly because you know that the foods you eat play a critical role in helping you achieve those goals. But are you taking a multi-vitamin? More importantly, are you taking the multi-vitamin that will help ensure that all the good food you’re eating is getting absorbed and utilized optimally? You want to be sure your body is getting the maximum benefit of your efforts. That’s why MHP developed ACTIVITE!\r\n\tTypical multi-vitamins and multi-packs may do very little to help further enhance the nutritional support from meals. ACTIVITE with Anabolase does alot! Anabolase is protected by two US patents and is backed by scientific studies from major universities. Here’s how it works: While vitamins and minerals are needed to support good health and proper body functions, macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and fats) are the real determinants of whether or not you will achieve your goals of building lean muscle, reducing body fat, increasing energy/endurance and maximizing performance. Anabolase is a patented interactive food optimizer that can actually improve the absorption and utilization of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. Anabolase is an anabolic enzyme system comprised of three advanced enzyme blends: Aminogen®, Carbogen® and Lipolase®. Each of these three enzymes provides a specific function to help you make better utilization of a meal.\r\n\tScientist’s Synopsis: Increased amino acid supply to muscle tissue helps cause an anabolic effect to stimulate muscle growth and recovery. As an athlete, you have a greater need for protein than a sedentary person. And while you may be eating enough protein, your body may not be utilizing it. If you aren’t utilizing it, you aren’t going to gain the muscle and strength you are looking for. Aminogen improves the utilization of protein from meals and increases the amount of amino acids delivered to your muscle tissue to stimulate growth and recovery.\r\n\t1. Helps the body naturally liberate free-form amino acids from food protein (much like breaking the links of a chain).\r\n\t2. Enhances the body’s absorption process by breaking peptide bonds, which attach amino acids to protein molecules.\r\n\t3. Seeks out protein molecules and helps the amino acid break free from the protein molecule, making it easier for the body to absorb the small molecule rather than a large protein molecule.\r\n\tFACT: Protein from food is broken down into amino acids. These amino acids serve as the building block to build and repair muscle.\r\n\tScientist’s Synopsis: Lipolase’s ability to break apart long chain triglycerides into smaller medium and short chain triglycerides increases the amount of fat available for your body to use for energy while also help to decrease the amount stored as body fat.\r\n\tLipolase allows you to utilize all forms of dietary fat as an efficient energy. Lipolase is a proprietary pH resistant active enzyme with a unique ability to break down triglycerides into fatty acids to be utilized by the Kreb cycle for energy in both low and high pH environments. Lipolase’s full range pH action allows for the breakdown of fats throughout the entire digestive system to promote maximum energy and increased utilization of body fat.\r\n\tACTIVITE is formulated based on research to deliver a properly balanced full spectrum of vitamins and minerals. It’s also one of the first multi-vitamin to address two very critical, but often overlooked, dosage factors. The first is absorption/utilization. Unfortunately, many multi-vitamin formulas don’t take absorption and utilization into full consideration. The typical multi-vitamin gives you forms of vitamins and minerals that your body may not be ready to use. Instead, your body has to convert them through a series of metabolic processes before they become active or usable. By doing this, usability, absorption and potency can be compromised. Not so in ACTIVITE. The vitamin C, B and mineral complexes in ACTIVITE are already in their active usable states, allowing for greater body usability, absorption and potency!\r\n\tThe second dosage factor that competing multi-vitamin formulas often don’t address is called ‘exponential synergies’. If you haven’t heard of this term yet, don’t be surprised. It’s a term used by advanced biochemists and nutritionists to describe the full impact of how vitamins and minerals interact for determining the proper dosage and combinations of nutrients in a formula.\r\n\tHere’s how it works: vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals have the unique ability to work synergistically. If the proper nutrients are combined in the proper ratios, they can help  re-energize and recycle one another — they’re replenished and utilized repetitively, creating ‘exponential synergies’. ACTIVITE has combined a hand-selected blend of special and precise micronutrients — vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals — in the exact ratios to maximize their synergistic effect and help establish and create ‘exponential synergies’.\r\n\tThe ‘Fully Reacted’ vitamin C complex in ACTIVITE includes mineral ascorbates of potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc and chromium. These mineral ascorbates provide the ultimate transport system for vitamin C, helping to maximize its absorption and utilization throughout the body. This also protects your body from losing valuable minerals.\r\n\tMost multi-vitamins include other forms of vitamin C such as Ascorbic Acid, which are only intermediate forms of vitamin C. Those forms need to react with minerals present in the liver to form mineral ascorbates of potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc and other trace elements. Unfortunately, this process reduces the body’s ability for proper absorption and also robs your body of precious minerals needed for bodily functions such as electrolyte balance and enzymatic reactions.\r\n\tACTIVITE’s mineral complex employs ‘Neutrally Charged’ Amino Acid Chelated Minerals. A chelated mineral is a mineral that is bonded to an amino acid. Chelation is a natural means for the body to transport minerals across the intestinal wall to help maximize absorption.\r\n\tAmino acid chelates are viewed to be scientifically superior to non-chelated forms because other forms of minerals lose integrity during digestion, become unstable and therefore reduce their bioavailability. Also, the body cannot utilize mineral compounds in their natural state. Any mineral sulfate, oxide or carbonate must be broken apart and restructured to allow it to be transported through the intestinal wall. In addition, these mineral compounds have an electrical charge and can deactivate other important nutrient factors, such as: Vitamin E, ascorbic acid, various B vitamins, as well as important medications. To overcome this, chelation is used. The body is very efficient at absorbing amino acids and by chelating minerals to amino acids; the amino acids cross the intestinal wall and bring the minerals with them. This transport system allows the minerals to be protected and carried across the intestinal lining into circulation for use. The chelated mineral complex in ACTIVITE is highly bioavailable and therefore a more effective means of obtaining mineral benefits.\r\n\tThe Coenzyme B vitamins used in ACTIVITE are in a form identical in nature to what your body uses and are in many cases, the form of B vitamins that will work for your needs. B vitamins must be processed by the body and turned into their coenzyme form before they can be utilized. Once they’re in coenzyme form, they are more readily absorbed and easily enter cells. Other forms of B vitamins commonly found in most products require a process to activate them. ACTIVITE contains an entire complex of B vitamins that already exist in their coenzyme form, eliminating the need for processing by the body and maximizing their benefits.\r\n\tFree radicals can have a negative impact on health and performance. It is important to know that exercise actually increases free radical production. During exercise, oxygen consumption greatly increases, which leads to increased free radical production and therefore a greater need for antioxidants. Free radicals can damage cells (a normal process), which then must be removed by the immune system. If free radical formation is not controlled within the muscle during exercise, a substantial amount of muscle can be affected. This damage to muscle tissue can hinder performance, muscle growth and recovery. Antioxidants work to protect cells from free radical damage. The most common measure of the power of an antioxidant is determined by its ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) rating, which measures its efficacy of quenching free radicals. ACTIVITE contains a blend of high ORAC free radical scavenging antioxidants to help protect your system and help you meet your goals of maximizing performance, triggering anabolic muscle growth and speeding recovery!\r\n\tThe importance of taking a multi-vitamin for good health is clear, but YOU WANT MORE — you want to build muscle, burn fat and improve performance. ACTIVITE is the multi that can give you it all. ACTIVITE not only provides you with a superior profile of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and antioxidants, it’s also the only enzyme-activated multi with Anabolase™, the powerhouse enzyme blend that makes ACTIVITE the Multi with Muscle! The Journal of the American Medical Association recommends that all Americans take a multi-vitamin! If you’re active, make sure your multi is ACTIVITE!\r\n\tTake 4 tablets once daily or 2 tablets twice daily (preferably with your largest meals for best absorption and maximum utilization of proteins, carbohydrates and fats).\r\n\tKeep out of reach of children.

This powerful combination of fast and slow proteins creates an “anabolic window” that lasts for hours.\r\n\tOur strategic use of Aminogen® (Patented Bio-Active Polypeptide Enzyme System), bromelain, papain, and lactase ensure extreme ease of digestion. These enzymes ensure the proteins in MONSTER MASS™ are delivered as free-form amino acids and small peptide chains to ensure maximum uptake and absorption. Plus MONSTER MASS™ is 98% lactose free, making it even easier to process.\r\n\tMONSTER MASS™ helps create positive nitrogen balance, the gold standard of anabolic potential. MONSTER MASS™ provides high levels of essential amino acids to bathe muscle fibers in an “anabolic soup” to stimulate protein synthesis and muscle growth (hypertrophy).\r\n\tCompleteness and balance to the extreme. Featuring Whey Concentrates, Whey Isolates, Isolated Milk Protein, Caseinates, Lactoferrin, L-Glutamine, Glutamine Peptides, and free-form BCAA’s L-Valine, L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine.\r\n\t500 mg of Aminogen® (a patented bio-enzyme proteolytic digestive system), bromelain, and papain ensure the breakdown of proteins into absorbable peptides.\r\n\tWaxy Maize Starch and Maltodextrin provide massive amounts of glucose energy to fuel muscle growth and recovery.

MONSTER MASS provides a blend of both fast-acting and extended-release proteins and does not contain creatine monohydrate. Lastly, MONSTER MASS delivers a 3:1:1 BCAA ratio and and 4 grams of added L-Leucine per serving.\r\n\t\t\tQ: Who can benefit from a weight gainer like MONSTER MASS?\r\n\t\t\tA: Anyone looking to increase caloric intake to increase muscle mass.\r\n\t\t\tMix 4 scoops (150g) into 18-20 fl-oz water. The optimal time for a serving of Monster Mass is 30-45 minutes immediately after your workout. This timing is critical because your muscles absorb approximately 80% of the aminos and carbs necessary to help them grow during the two hour period immediately following exercise. Depending on your weight gain and caloric needs take Monster Mass as a snack or as a meal addition. CytoSport products complement a healthful eating and hydration plan that, when combined with a balanced exercise program may contribute to healthy weight management and recovery from exercise.

      "text": "Muscle Milk Gainer is for those who have trouble gaining size and strength, both of which are lost when fewer calories are consumed than expended.  This is called the catabolic gap (or negative calorie balance).  Muscle Milk Gainer helps provide calories needed to close the catabolic gap so you can achieve and maintain the results you work so hard for.  Mix 4 scoops (162g) with 16-20 fl-oz water for a great tasting shake* or add to smoothies and other recipes (see below).\r\n\tMilk Gainer's Protein System is designed to deliver protein over an extended period of time. The Protein System includes fast acting whey proteins (Whey Concentrate, Hydrolysate and Isolate) and the slower acting casein proteins (Milk Protein Isolate, Calcium Sodium Caseinate and Micellar Casein). Together, this blend of premium proteins is formulated to provide hours of gaining potential. Carbs are burned for muscle energy so protein is \"spared\" for its primary job: muscle repair and growth. Additionally, carbs help activate the powerful growth promoting hormone insulin that helps trigger transport of the amino acids (from digested protein) into muscle tissues. Put in the hard work and Muscle Milk Gainer will help close the nutrition gap so even the hardest gainer can make progress.\r\n\t*Recommended usage for individuals looking to build size and gain muscle mass.\r\n\tUses: Pre-workout, post-workout, or as a protein-rich snack to add calories to diet\r\n\tPRECISION PROTEIN BLEND\r\n\tWe’ve developed a unique mix of complete multi-source proteins.  These include milk protein isolate, calcium sodium caseinate, whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, micellar casein, whey protein hydrolysate, lactoferrin, L-glutamine and taurine, which provide amino acids - the building blocks of muscle tissue. Translation?  High quality protein to help you recover from exercise and build muscle. \r\n\tCARBOHYDRATES AND PROTEINS WORK TOGETHER\r\n\tMuscle Milk Gainer provides a combination of 32g protein and 109–110g carbohydrates†, which the body can use after exercise to help replenish glycogen stores, establish positive protein balance and increase insulin levels. What are we trying to say?  Muscle Milk Gainer provides carbohydrates and proteins that work together to replenish glycogen stores and stimulate muscle protein synthesis and recovery from exercise. \r\n\t†Based on 4 scoops (162g), the recommended usage for individuals looking to build size and gain muscle mass.\r\n\tQ:  WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO DRINK MUSCLE MILK?\r\n\tA:  Muscle Milk should be consumed as directed on the label.  Muscle Milk can be consumed before workouts, after workouts, first thing in the morning or prior to bedtime.  In addition, Muscle Milk can be used as a meal replacement when you are on the go or as a high protein snack during the day.  But, keep in mind that individual nutritional requirements vary depending on gender, body weight, level of activity and exercise/training intensity and duration.  So, it is best to use Muscle Milk as part of a well-balanced diet that includes whole foods and other protein sources.  We do not recommend Muscle Milk be used as your sole source of nutrition.\r\n\tQ:  WHO CAN DRINK MUSCLE MILK?\r\n\tA:  The short answer is Muscle Milk can be used by almost anyone that is not allergic to dairy proteins.  Plenty of athletes drink Muscle Milk because they may have increased protein requirements, but it is fine for anyone that wants to supplement their protein intake.  The proteins in Muscle Milk may be especially helpful when you are:\r\n\tQ:  ARE YOUR PRODUCTS CERTIFIED KOSHER? \r\n\tA:  All flavors of Muscle Milk, Muscle Milk Light and Muscle Milk Collegiate ready-to-drink products are certified Kosher by the Orthodox Union and this is indicated by the  symbol on the label.  Currently, CytoSport powder drink mixes and bars are not Kosher certified.\r\n\tQ:  WHICH CYTOSPORT PRODUCTS ARE LACTOSE FREE?\r\n\tA:  All flavors of Muscle Milk, Muscle Milk Light and Muscle Milk Collegiate ready-to-drink products are lactose free.  Muscle Milk, Muscle Milk Gainer, Muscle Milk Light and Muscle Milk Naturals powders are also lactose free.\r\n\tRecommended usage for individuals loo king to build size and gain muscle mass: Mix 6 oz.

This must-have CPS muscle building supplement also contains Agmatine, which is a novel analog of L-Arginine. Agmatine, in the preferred Agmatine Sulfate form, has shown greater potential than L-Arginine for nitric oxide synthase, in early stage work. Additionally, Agmatine has been suggested in the scientific literature to have other properties that could have direct benefits to athletes and bodybuilders, too.

      "text": "TRANSFORM YOUR BODY AND ALTER YOUR MIND\r\n\tDREN belongs to a powerful new class of compounds called mesolimbic beta agonists, which have extremely powerful fat burning and euphoric activities. Drenbuterol is a patent pending compound scientifically formulated to stimulate both metabolic and mesolimbic pathways for extreme thermogenic fat burning and neurotropic “feel good” sensory. Each DREN capsule provides the maximum 409mg dose of Drenbuterol and should only be administered once daily and not be used with other stimulants. When taken as directed, DREN will help stimulate the thermogenic fat burning process, increase energy levels, help control appetite and elicit a state of heightened mental euphoria and well being.\r\n\t\tFAQ\r\n\t\tDren uses an advanced pharmacological approach to trigger the process of lipolysis for maximum fat burning called Beta-Methoxy Phenylethlyamine (Beta-Metoxy PEA). Dren belongs to a powerful new class of compounds called mesolimbic Beta Agonist Fat Burning Agents. Dren poses more selective and powerful beta-adrenergic fat burning activity than similar products.

Studies show that L-Glutamine plays a role in protein synthesis, and at the same time helps to promote an anabolic state by down-regulating catabolic activity. In fact, some important researchers are now suggesting that Glutamine might be the most important of all amino acids – as it provides a component in muscle metabolism and cellular support not shared by any other single amino acid. In addition to L-Glutamine, CPS incorporates Trans-Alanyl-Glutamine, which may be more optimally taken up into the blood stream providing for greater muscle tissue levels of L-Glutamine.

      "text": "Lecheek Nutrition's NEW Cycle Armor: The Pinnicle of Cycling Protection & Daily Health!\r\n\tLeCheek Nutrition's NEW Cycle Armor is the next big on cycle and men's health product to hit the market. Formulated specifically with key components to keep your organs safe on a cycle and off.  Cycle Armor contains 6 of the most key ingredients to keep you healthy on cycle and to help maintain your overall health post cycle. Key Scientifically proven ingredients like Celery Seed,  Hawthorne Berry, and N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) are a few of the ingredients that you will find in each serving in Cycle Armour.\r\n\tCycle Armor was designed to protect, maintain, and restore heart, liver, and prostate health during and off cycle. This product is an all YEAR ROUND Product. Specifically designed for ON cycle but can be just as beneficial for overall health off cycle.\r\n\t \r\n\tCycle Armor Key Features:\r\n\tCycle Armor Key Ingredients:\r\n\tMilk Thistle\r\n\tThe antioxidant milk thistle has been used since Greco-Roman times to treat an array of liver ailments.  Several studies suggest milk thistle protects the liver from damaging toxins such as alcohol and certain drugs.  The active component most responsible for milk thistle's detoxifying effects is called silymarin.  This substance, comprised of several flavonolignands, helps repair liver cells damaged by toxins as well as protecting healthy liver cells.  It has also been purported to have cholesterol lowering benefits as well.\r\n\tN-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC)\r\n\tNAC, arguably the pinnacle antioxidant, consists of the amino acid cysteine joined with an acetyl group making it more soluble and more biovailable than L-Cysteine alone.  NAC , basically a precursor to glutathione, donates cystiene to form glutathione which is found in the body and produced in the liver.  NAC has been shown in studies to prevent cell death.    \r\n\tSaw Palmetto\r\n\tRich in phytosterols and fatty acids, Saw Palmetto has been used in treating BPH as well as male pattern baldness.  This is largely due to its supposed ability to inhibit 5-alpha reductase, an enzyme responsible for converting precious testosterone into DHT, and interfering with DHT's binding ability to androgen receptors.\r\n\tHawthorne Berry\r\n\tHawthorn Berry is highly recognized herb for the heart and cardiovascular system. It has the ability to dilate (enlarge or open) the coronary arteries (the vessels that supply blood to the heart), thus improving blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle. It also strengthens the hearts pumping ability (muscle), helping the heart to beat more forcefully and efficiently. In addition, hawthorne appears to dilate the highways of other blood vessels around the body, thereby allowing blood to circulate more freely with less strain on the heart. Another benefit of hawthorne berry is that it harbors potent antioxidant properties, which are believed to exert cholesterol lowering effects and reduce the accumulation of fatty plague in the arteries the hallmark of atherosclerosis.\r\n\tCelery Seed Extract\r\n\t3nB is the active compound that is unique to celery. 3nB was discovered as the active component of celery in response to investigations by researchers seeking to explain some of the medicinal effects of celery including the lowering of blood pressure and the relief of arthritis. High blood pressure is usually the result of too much fluid there is in your blood and how flexible or resistant your blood vessels are. Retention of sodium (salt) leads to increase fluid volume in the blood while hardening of the arteries and the hormones released during stress lead to loss of flexibility or constriction of blood flow. In treating high blood pressure, doctors usually prescribed diuretics (water pills) to reduce the fluid volume and vasodilators to relax the arteries to reduce the resistance of blood flow or beta-blockers to turn down the pumping action of the heart. 3nB appears to help lower blood pressure by both acting as a diuretic and vasodilator through impacting the production of prostaglandins as well as acting in a similar manner to drugs known as calcium-channel blockers. 3nB has also been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce the formation of arterial plaque in experimental studies. This effect may increase the elasticity of the blood vessels and also lead to lower blood pressure readings. 3nB also appears to promote some effects on areas and systems of the brain that control vascular resistance.\r\n\tPygeum Bark\r\n\tPygeum is a herbal remedy containing extracts from the bark of Prunus africana. It is used to alleviate some of the discomfort caused by inflammation in patients suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate). Bark extract is marketed under the brand-names of Pigenil in Italy and Tadenan in France and used commonly in its natural forms in traditional African medicine.\r\n\tTake 2 capsules with food.
